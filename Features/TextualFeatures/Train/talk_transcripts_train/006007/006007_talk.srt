to play after this.

4
00:00:09,659 --> 00:00:11,179
PART.2: Yes, not really.

00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:15,259

are for me supercomplicated.

12
00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:42,059
PART.2: Yes, so normally we can play
until the sunset
which is at 10pm or 9pm.

until 8pm or 8:30pm.

16
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:56,779

00:00:56,779 --> 00:00:58,579
PART.2: Yes, after work.

18
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:01,659
PART.1: But you guys
are always going to Ciutadella?

19
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:13,659
PART.2: It is good to go there
because it is a bit covered
and it helps and is less windy.

20
00:01:13,779 --> 00:01:14,459
PART.1: Yes.

21
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:14,499
PART.2: But it is also too crowded,
that's a big problem

22
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:14,659
PART.2: and sometimes we have to wait
for like an hour before we can play
unless we are lucky

23
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:14,779
PART.2: and we know someone
who is already playing
and let us join.

24
00:01:14,779 --> 00:01:18,499
PART.2: But it is also too crowded,
that's a big problem

for like an hour before we can play
unless we are lucky

26
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:27,659
PART.2: and we know someone
who is already playing
and let us join.

27
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:38,979
PART.2: Otherwise, there are not
a lot of good places, I mean,
not all tables are even
or some tables are broken.

28
00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:42,979
PART.1: Yes, I really like the La Placídia.

29
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:43,419

PART.1: I sometimes too like
that table is close
to your current office

39
00:01:55,899 --> 00:02:00,419
PART.1: and sometimes we could go there
to play after work

40
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:04,979

and have a drink or something.

41

00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:36,499
PART.1: I mean,
I'd probably actually go
like the post weekend

53
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:39,779
PART.1: because our friends
can only go the first weekend

54
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:45,379
PART.1: and the other people
I think they prefer the next weekend
so maybe we'll end up going

55
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:45,579
PART.1: I mean,
I'd probably actually go
like the post weekend

00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:53,979

00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:04,259

or how does this holiday work?

65
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:04,339

70
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:15,859

71
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:16,299
PART.1: Yes, so you can rent parcels
and then in every parcel,

72
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:16,419
PART.1: I think there's a limited
amount of tents that can fit

73
00:03:16,499 --> 00:03:16,579

to know how many people
want to go and how many tents

83
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:44,059
PART.1: and then we just resolve
the parcels and places.

84
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:50,259
PART.2: But is it like in the nature

00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:53,419
PART.1: The camping is next to the beach,
it has a private access
to some small base

90
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:53,579
PART.1: and then you go up to the camping
area and some spots have like a view
to the see.

118
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:56,859

00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:56,739

for the rest of the weekend
