PART.1: and maybe you have some advice
to give me on what to do next

83
00:03:07,872 --> 00:03:14,152
PART.1: because I was considering
if should I go for the PhD
but I am not so sure about it.

84
00:03:15,952 --> 00:03:18,552
PART.2: So you did in distributed systems?

85
00:03:18,672 --> 00:03:19,672
PART.1: Yes.

86
00:03:19,672 --> 00:03:21,672

into networking, I mean,

88
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:30,952
PART.1: my thesis was in program analysis
using machine learning.

89
00:03:35,272 --> 00:03:36,272
PART.2: Ok.

90
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:38,272
PART.1: Yes, I know a little
about machine learning.

91
00:03:39,272 --> 00:03:44,952
PART.2: I would say
I would try to go for industry
at least a couple of years
of experience in industry,
