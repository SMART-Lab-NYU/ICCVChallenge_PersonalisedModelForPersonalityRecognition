1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,612
PART.1: Okay

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,063
PART.1: He's going out so if you would like we can talk like whatever, asuposed to someone who's sitting here.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,840
PART.2: Yes. Isn't it more...Isn't it more awkward when you're with someone you don't know?

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,160
PART.1: Yeah. Games were not awkward because we have a task to do.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,658
PART.2: Before, weren't you supposed to do this warm up first?

6
00:00:18,738 --> 00:00:22,560
PART.1: Yeah sure ...

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,878
PART.1: It's fine because you can ask his name. You don't even know his name. Stuff like this.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,683
PART.2: OK, what's your name?

9
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:34,320
PART.1: Viola and it's really hard because no one knows Viola.

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,265
PART.1: But it's in German. I want to be called Viola.

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,458
PART.2: I doubt anyone would know my name.

12
00:00:39,538 --> 00:00:40,680
PART.1: Yeza. Yeza. What?

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,595
PART.1: Yeza is like...What resemblance is this. ... It's very beautiful.

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,337
PART.2: I hope so, I hope so. It would be easier to spell and people will find it. Anywhere.

15
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:55,760
PART.1: Maybe I should say Viola because people know it but I don't want to be called Viola.

16
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,598
PART.2: Yeah, Viola's OK.

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,450
PART.1: Viola.

18
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:06,600
PART.2: But for this experiment that person is only going to see you maybe. No for like another 40 minutes and forget about you.

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,625
PART.1: That's true. I can't remember his name.

20
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,920
PART.2: But it's recorded. Maybe you shouldn't be manipulating your name.

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,818
PART.1: Manipulating my name, what?

22
00:01:15,898 --> 00:01:20,280
PART.2: You shouldn't be changing your name because that thing is recorded.

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,520
PART.2: Yeah, they can sense you. When you're lying.

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,613
PART.1: Oh yeah. Maybe. It would be interesting to see. When your heart rate is going up. Like no pressure.

25
00:01:27,693 --> 00:01:31,853
PART.2: My heart rate is going up. Right now I am nervous. I don't know why.

26
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:35,797
PART.1: In the beginning I was very nervous but the second time it's okay.

27
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,700
PART.2: And it's with you imagine if it was with someone else.

28
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:41,043
PART.1: If it was someone else it would be very awkward in the beginning, but after some time you warm up.

29
00:01:41,022 --> 00:01:45,017
PART.1: You're like, OK, your one team together against this task.

30
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:47,983
PART.2: Oh, okay. That would be nice. So you stop playing against each other.

31
00:01:45,798 --> 00:01:47,798
PART.1: It's really quite good.

32
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:50,903
PART.1: ... No, I'm sure they'll tell. Sorry.

33
00:01:50,558 --> 00:01:53,308
PART.2: Anyway, don't tell me. So what's for dinner tonight?

34
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:57,585
PART.1: Something warm ... Soup?

35
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,097
PART.2: The honey was not healthy?

36
00:01:59,097 --> 00:02:00,325
PART.1: I don't know.

37
00:02:00,325 --> 00:02:04,775
PART.1: No. It's getting... Sometimes. I think in the evenings it's always works worse, in the mornings it's fine. I don't know.

38
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:06,130
PART.2: I hope so.

39
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,967
PART.1: Or we could watch...Should we go to this Catalan restaurant?

40
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,583
PART.2: Oh, maybe we can.

41
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:16,875
PART.1: I mean we are ...

42
00:02:17,235 --> 00:02:19,235
PART.1: But it's only one hour we have.

43
00:02:19,593 --> 00:02:23,243
PART.1: And we have to go back already.

44
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,235
PART.2: Oh yeah yeah yeah. No no I don‚Äôt Alexa can leave with us anyway.

45
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:31,165
PART.1: But only for us it's only one hour food...for food.

46
00:02:30,057 --> 00:02:35,453
PART.2: I don't think it's an hour because we. Very close to our place, we need like half an hour.

47
00:02:34,393 --> 00:02:38,155
PART.1: All right it was not near of this place.

48
00:02:35,997 --> 00:02:37,170
PART.2: No.

49
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,860
PART.1: No. OK.

50
00:02:38,437 --> 00:02:43,165
PART.2: I was near this tower that looks like a bullet for me, I don't know why.

51
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,140
PART.1: Yeah it's this weird thing like you said.

52
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:50,037
PART.2: Like you were saying, I don't think it's worth it to go back.

53
00:02:47,912 --> 00:02:52,540
PART.1: Alexa mentioned some burger shop but I don't I'm not sure if I want to eat a burger.

54
00:02:51,853 --> 00:02:53,480
PART.2: I don't like burger.

55
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:56,803
PART.1: OK then we don't eat there.

56
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:57,793
PART.2: We can walk around here maybe I don't know.

57
00:02:57,278 --> 00:03:01,458
PART.1: It is up to you.. Some pret.

58
00:02:59,897 --> 00:03:03,775
PART.1: ... I love Pret.

59
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,453
PART.2: Oh we didn't have your green tea.

60
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,660
PART.1: I haven't finished it but I can ...

61
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,940
PART.1: Exactly but I am waiting for you.

62
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,935
PART.2: Waiting for me for what?

63
00:03:12,015 --> 00:03:14,015
PART.2: Oh, a second one. OK yeah.

64
00:03:13,535 --> 00:03:16,197
PART.2: Or we can just go home.

65
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,900
PART.2: Leave me.

66
00:03:17,293 --> 00:03:20,688
PART.1: I'm not sure if it's not nice.

67
00:03:20,795 --> 00:03:22,795
PART.2: What are you going to do at home?

68
00:03:23,148 --> 00:03:30,590
PART.1: Sleeping on this couch. I will sleep on the couch. For 30 minutes. Just imagine this couch.

69
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:33,948
PART.1: We can't go separated because we have one ticket.

70
00:03:34,305 --> 00:03:36,305
PART.2: I'll see.

71
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,660
PART.1: I complete you.

72
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,690
PART.2: I should take the ticket.

73
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,985
PART.1: I can go shopping.

74
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,988
PART.2: I should take the ticket.

75
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:43,865
PART.1: Yeah, yeah ...

76
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,338
PART.1: I think because I have no money left anymore.

77
00:03:45,898 --> 00:03:49,762
PART.2: I don't have a lot of money left either. But I don't have a phone even.

78
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:53,410
PART.1: That's really scary. So you're really dependent on me.

79
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,193
PART.2: I hate to admit it.

80
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,640
PART.1: Is it scary for you?

81
00:03:59,842 --> 00:04:05,975
PART.2: But I should find a way to recharge online. I tried this morning but it wasn't very obvious. So I said try again.

82
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:13,548
PART.1: Because for me it's like I can login with mine and I can charge it with my account number from my bank.

83
00:04:13,815 --> 00:04:15,510
PART.2: Oh, okay, okay.

84
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:16,053
PART.1: It was not possible for you?

85
00:04:15,593 --> 00:04:25,768
PART.2: It was like automatic re-charged whenever my account is less than some thing automatically it recharges. I don't want it to automatically recharge every time. I just like this time.

86
00:04:26,028 --> 00:04:30,323
PART.1: It's not helping because you don't have less. Anything.

87
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,400
PART.1: It's more of a problem because you have ... over.

88
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:33,988
PART.2: Exactly.

89
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:40,263
PART.2: I don't know I only saw those two options for automatic re-charging but I didn't see an option for... I just want to recharge it now once.

90
00:04:40,555 --> 00:04:48,063
PART.1: It's so not nice to just cut you off without a warning because there was no SMS or some thing. No message telling you.

91
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,625
PART.2: I think they sent me a warning.

92
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:51,722
PART.2: ...But not now...

93
00:04:51,228 --> 00:04:55,728
PART.2: I don't know, like your something ends in two weeks.

94
00:04:56,493 --> 00:04:59,153
PART.1: But you're really sure that it's this one. Because...

95
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,495
PART.2: Yeah. It happened before.

96
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:01,237
PART.1: OK.

97
00:05:00,765 --> 00:05:04,402
PART.2: It happened, I always forget recharging and then charge it.

98
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:06,608
PART.1: It's already too late.

99
00:05:06,865 --> 00:05:11,652
PART.1: ... I couldn't do this before the internet. I mean, I'm really dependent on this.

100
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:15,302
PART.1: I mean you're in a new city and you...

101
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:19,603
PART.2: Oh yeah for a new city it's...

102
00:05:18,513 --> 00:05:22,117
PART.1: OK, last month I was...yeah but OK sure.

103
00:05:22,503 --> 00:05:25,538
PART.1: ...I wouldn't need it.

104
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,900
PART.1: Well it's better to save money.

105
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:30,673
PART.1: It might be a way to go.
