82
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:13,548
PART.1: Because for me it's like I can login with mine and I can charge it with my account number from my bank.

83
00:04:13,815 --> 00:04:15,510
PART.2: Oh, okay, okay.

84
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:16,053
PART.1: It was not possible for you?

85
00:04:15,593 --> 00:04:25,768
PART.2: It was like automatic re-charged whenever my account is less than some thing automatically it recharges. I don't want it to automatically recharge every time. I just like this time.

00:04:26,028 --> 00:04:30,323
PART.1: It's not helping because you don't have less. Anything.

87
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,400

00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:33,988
PART.2: Exactly.

00:04:40,555 --> 00:04:48,063
PART.1: It's so not nice to just cut you off without a warning because there was no SMS or some thing. No message telling you.

91
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,625
PART.2: I think they sent me a warning.

92
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:51,722
PART.2: ...But not now...

93
00:04:51,228 --> 00:04:55,728
PART.2: I don't know, like your something ends in two weeks.

94
00:04:56,493 --> 00:04:59,153
PART.1: But you're really sure that it's this one. Because...

95
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,495
PART.2: Yeah. It happened before.
