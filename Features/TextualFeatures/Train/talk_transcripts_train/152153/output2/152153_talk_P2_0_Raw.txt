Yes. Isn't it more...Isn't it more awkward when you're with someone you don't know? 
Before, weren't you supposed to do this warm up first? 
OK, what's your name? 
I doubt anyone would know my name. 
I hope so, I hope so. It would be easier to spell and people will find it. Anywhere. 
Yeah, Viola's OK. 
But for this experiment that person is only going to see you maybe. No for like another 40 minutes and forget about you.
