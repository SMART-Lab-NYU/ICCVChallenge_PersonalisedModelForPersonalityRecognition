Oh we didn't have your green tea. 
Waiting for me for what? 
Oh, a second one. OK yeah. 
Or we can just go home. 
Leave me. 
What are you going to do at home? 
I'll see. 
I should take the ticket. 
I should take the ticket. 
I don't have a lot of money left either. But I don't have a phone even. 
I hate to admit it. 
But I should find a way to recharge online. I tried this morning but it wasn't very obvious. So I said try again.
