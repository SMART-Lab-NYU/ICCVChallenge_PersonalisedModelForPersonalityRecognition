So we can discuss on tomorrow meeting. 
Why not? 
I am not very good at that. 
Yes. 
I think, I don't know, but to me is always a problemto start conversations.
Yes, I don't know. 
In English, it is my problem, but in my language, no.
Because sometimes I feel that maybe I say something wrong in English,because my English it's not perfect.
I don't know how to start the chat but in my language I think I am good.
