49
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:08,387
PART.2: from Italy.

50
00:02:08,014 --> 00:02:11,536
PART.2: Coz like my grand-grand-fathers
they left Italy

51
00:02:11,576 --> 00:02:18,340
PART.2: and they went to Brazil. This was
very normal like 150 years ago...

52
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:20,764
PART.2: more or less

53
00:02:20,964 --> 00:02:23,264
PART.2: when a lot of Italians they
left Europe

54
00:02:23,464 --> 00:02:25,764
PART.2: to go to South America

55
00:02:25,964 --> 00:02:28,264
PART.1: Because of resources
or...

56
00:02:28,192 --> 00:02:30,494

have like...

57
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:36,091

they have a lot of land there

58
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:40,752

PART.2: to work in the land.

60
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:49,009
PART.2: So  the Brazilian government and
also the Argentinian, the Uruguayan

61
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:53,026
PART.2: I think that they gave like land
for them to produce

62
00:02:53,226 --> 00:02:55,526
PART.2: so then they came to Brazil.

63
00:02:55,851 --> 00:03:01,049

PART.2: Yeah I think it changes a lot.
It's very dynamic.

101
00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:11,105
PART.1: It depends on the
economy

102
00:05:10,475 --> 00:05:12,774
PART.2: Exactly...

103
00:05:12,743 --> 00:05:15,354

as well.

104
00:05:15,473 --> 00:05:21,083

it's not a stable job

105
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:28,093
PART.1: I think it's quite
common for all the jobs with

106
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,829
PART.1: respect to the economy. If the
economy goes down everybody go down

107
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:33,468
PART.2: Yeah...it's true

108
00:05:33,923 --> 00:05:38,278
PART.1: In Computer Science for
instance nobody is going to invest.

109
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:40,617
PART.2: That's right.

110
00:05:39,427 --> 00:05:41,728
PART.1: in Artificial Intelligence

111
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:47,238
PART.1: then everybody is going to lose
jobs. It's because you need to sell

112
00:05:46,716 --> 00:05:50,194
PART.1: the product...and if the
economy goes down...

113
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,516
