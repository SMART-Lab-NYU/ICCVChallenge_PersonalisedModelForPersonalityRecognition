Yeah. Yes. There are PhDs in business.Yeah.
Um...I did my Master in Project Management.
So that like basically you learn how to manage a project...all that
to work with things... 
but yeah, of course, there are like PhDs in this area...as....
as jobs....because then you can mix like economics with business and
even math. You can do like mathematics with business
and all that. You can apply different fields.
