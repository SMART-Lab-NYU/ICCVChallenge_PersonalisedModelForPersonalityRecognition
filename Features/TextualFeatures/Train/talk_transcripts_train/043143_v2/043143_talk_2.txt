Italy.

48
00:02:07,706 --> 00:02:14,466
PART.2: Coz like my grand-grand-fathers
they left Italy and they went to
Brazil.

49
00:02:14,986 --> 00:02:19,226
PART.2: This was very normal
like 150 years ago...

50
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,186
PART.2: More or less.

51
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:26,146
PART.2: When a lot of Italians they
left Europe to go to South America.

52
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,746

00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:36,146

55
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:42,306

the Argentinian, the Uruguayan.
