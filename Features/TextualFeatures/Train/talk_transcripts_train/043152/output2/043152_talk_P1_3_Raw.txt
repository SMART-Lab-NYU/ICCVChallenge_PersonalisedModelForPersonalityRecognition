Yes, definitely. 
There is a lot of things to do, I agree with youthat there are a lot of tourists,specially in this time of the year.
There is like the summer that is calmly, the city is warmerlike we have more visitors.
But it is nice, I like it. 
I came to study, but like open-mindedto say maybe it is a place to visit,
to live and of course it is one city when you visit itas a tourist
and it is a different city when you actually live,
But I am having a good time, I don't have complainsand I have friends already.
