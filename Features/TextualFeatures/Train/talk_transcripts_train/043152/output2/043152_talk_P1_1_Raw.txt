Ah, ok. 
I live in Barcelona for almost three years now.
I started as a master, I came here to study.
I started as a master, I came here to study.
I started as a master, I came here to study.
Then I have a master in Project Managementand then I decided to stay.
I was doing my Italian citizenshipin the meantime of my master.
Italian citizenship, my family is from Italy,I am Brazilian
but my family came a long time ago
so we can apply for the double citizenship.
Yes, for the Italians yes, the problem is thatthere is a lot of bureaucracy,
you have to find all the birth certificates from very, very farfrom my family.
So, I mean, you don't have to speak Italianbut you have to find the papers...
