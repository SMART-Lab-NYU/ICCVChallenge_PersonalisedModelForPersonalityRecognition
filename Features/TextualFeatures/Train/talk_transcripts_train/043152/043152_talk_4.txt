105
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:01,169
PART.2: and you have a lot of people,
you met a lot of people.

106
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:04,689
PART.1: Yes, now I am working so yes.

107
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:06,689
PART.2: But you want to stay here?

108
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:08,889
PART.1: Well, that's a good question.

109
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:10,889
PART.2: Ok, no one can tell.

110
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:18,729
PART.1: It's hard to say,
for the moment yes
but of course I miss my family,

111
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:23,569
PART.1: so sometimes I say maybe
but for the moment yes.

112
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:33,969
PART.1: Let's say, two or three weeks ago
my parents came for the first time.

113
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:34,569
PART.2: Yes, wow!

114
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:35,529
PART.1: So it was nice for the
first time.

115
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:35,969
PART.2: Yes, wow!

116
00:04:35,969 --> 00:04:36,369
PART.1: So it was nice for the
first time.

117
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:41,369
PART.2: For the first time,
it is far away
so it is quite an effort for them.

118
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:51,769
PART.1: It is far
and they have a certain age
so the trip is not easy for them.

119
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:54,889
PART.1: But they had a very good time.

120
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:56,169
PART.2: That's nice, it's cool.

121
00:04:56,169 --> 00:05:01,489
PART.1: So, first in Europe
and from here we went to Italy.
