PART.2: Ok. studying.

61
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:14,369
PART.1: I started as a master,
I came here to study.

62
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:14,769
PART.1: I started as a master,
I came here to study.

63
00:01:15,889 --> 00:01:20,569
PART.1: Then I have a master
in Project Management
and then I decided to stay.

64
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:26,969
PART.1: I was doing
my Italian citizenship
in the meantime of my master.

65
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:27,969
PART.2: What is it?

66
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:32,969
PART.1: Italian citizenship,
my family is from Italy,
I am Brazilian

67
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:35,369
PART.1: but my family came
a long time ago

68
00:01:35,449 --> 00:01:38,369
PART.1: so we can apply
for the double citizenship.

69
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,369
PART.2: So you need to do a test
or are you just...?

70
00:01:40,449 --> 00:01:42,889

and it's fine and you just have it?

71
00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:50,969
PART.1: Yes, for the Italians yes,
the problem is that
there is a lot of bureaucracy,

72
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:58,169
PART.1: you have to find all the birth
certificates from very, very far
from my family.

73
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:04,489
PART.1: So, I mean,
you don't have to speak Italian
but you have to find the papers...

74
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:11,969
PART.1: And I was able to have
the Italian passport
and then I decided to stay here.

75
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:16,969
PART.1: Well, at least for the moment

PART.1: Frankfurt yes.

79
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:26,089
PART.2: But Darmstadt no one knows,
it is a university city
so there are a lot of students.

80
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:29,169
PART.1: But it is very close from Frankfurt.

81
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:30,289

82
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:31,369
PART.1: Ok.

83
00:02:31,369 --> 00:02:33,369
PART.2: But it is like a big city.

84
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:38,169

is from the same place
or you live...?

85
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:43,769

00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:57,569
PART.2: Yes, I never visited it before.

91
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:00,529
PART.2: I mean, it is very touristic
but it is nice to have
someone here,

92
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:03,769
PART.2: this is very cool and someone can
tell you things like: "This is cool
or this is cool".

93
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:07,769
PART.2: And you are not
the typical tourist walking around
like "I don't know what to do".

94
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:09,769
PART.1: Yes, definitely.

95
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:18,369
PART.1: There is a lot of things to do,
I agree with you
that there are a lot of tourists,
specially in this time of the year.

96
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,489
PART.2: Oh, yes.

97
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:25,969
PART.1: There is like the summer
that is calmly, the city is warmer
like we have more visitors.

98
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:28,969
PART.1: But it is nice, I like it.

99
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:37,929
PART.1: I came to study,
but like open-minded
to say maybe it is a place to visit,

100
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:43,929
PART.1: to live and of course
it is one city when you visit it
as a tourist

101
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:48,489
PART.1: and it is a different city
when you actually live,

102
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:55,569
PART.1: But I am having a good time,
I don't have complains
and I have friends already.

103
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,649
PART.2: That's a point, I mean,
you studied here

104
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:00,969
PART.2: and you have a lot of people,
you met a lot of people.

00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:08,889
PART.1: Well, that's a good question.

109
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:10,889
PART.2: Ok, no one can tell.

110
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:18,729
PART.1: It's hard to say,
for the moment yes
but of course I miss my family,

111
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:23,569
PART.1: so sometimes I say maybe
but for the moment yes.

112
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:33,969

PART.2: For the first time,
it is far away
so it is quite an effort for them.

118
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:51,769
PART.1: It is far
and they have a certain age
so the trip is not easy for them.

119
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:54,889
PART.1: But they had a very good time.

120
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:56,169

124
00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:07,689

125
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:08,089
