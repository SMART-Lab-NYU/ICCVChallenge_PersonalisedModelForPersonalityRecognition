34
00:01:35,268 --> 00:01:40,948
PART.1: I had a feeling the other one was giving me time. You too. Can you give me some time to get some cards so I don't lose at zero.

35
00:01:41,388 --> 00:01:43,068

PART.2: Am I right?

40
00:01:59,668 --> 00:02:01,108
PART.1: I think so because the blue or the green is there.

41
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:02,548
PART.2: The chair.

42
00:02:02,628 --> 00:02:04,091
PART.1: Yeah makes sense.

43
00:02:04,188 --> 00:02:07,028
PART.1: Once someone cracks it I'm like yeah that makes sense.

44
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:12,228
PART.1: Maybe this one?

45
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:12,988
PART.2: Yeah.

46
00:02:13,068 --> 00:02:23,108
PART.1: You waited for me. Jesus. Oh my God. You can do it. It's like I wanted to let eou some chance but I still...

00:02:23,428 --> 00:02:25,428
PART.2: If you just look.

48
00:02:25,508 --> 00:02:28,175
PART.1: I'm super slow at this. Come on. This one, oh.

49
00:02:29,828 --> 00:02:31,748
PART.2: So maybe you weren't looking.

50
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:33,828
PART.1: No it's fine I was looking.

51
00:02:33,948 --> 00:02:34,948
PART.2: Okay.

52
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:39,868
PART.1: I think so yeah.

53
00:02:39,988 --> 00:02:41,588
PART.2: I think so too.

54
00:02:41,668 --> 00:02:43,228
PART.2: Do you want to play again?

55
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:56,228
PART.1: No! I'm not sure in my head it's like I'm seeing pardons. Patterns. Like this is green, this is red and then like OK I have to look for the book. Oh it's a ghost...

56
00:02:56,348 --> 00:02:59,588
PART.1: I'm really fast with colors but the other one is really not working.

57
00:02:59,668 --> 00:03:10,748
PART.2: For me I think at some point., You stop thinking about it and you start like looking at it. You just let your brain work it out and you're like OK this isn‚Äôt the same.

58
00:03:10,868 --> 00:03:12,788
PART.1: I already thought I got better than before.

59
00:03:12,868 --> 00:03:13,468
PART.2: Oh really?

60
00:03:13,548 --> 00:03:27,508
PART.1: It was really not good and sometimes it was also intuition like OK it's not there at all.
The subject is not there but I don't know. ,
Maybe I want to feel like sure sure.
Maybe I'm just slow.

61
00:03:27,868 --> 00:03:29,868
PART.2: Maybe you're very, very analytic.

62
00:03:29,948 --> 00:03:34,588
PART.1: I can't tell, I have no idea for it. I have no art for it. I don't know. I don't know.

63
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,588
PART.2: I would go for it even if it was wrong.

64
00:03:37,828 --> 00:03:39,508
PART.2: What would happen if it was wrong?

65
00:03:39,588 --> 00:03:41,828
PART.1: The other one can choose.

66
00:03:41,948 --> 00:03:42,988
PART.2: I have to wait for you to choose?

67
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:43,428
PART.1: Yeah.

68
00:03:43,508 --> 00:03:45,228
PART.2: He didn't say that.

69
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:50,028
PART.1: I asked last time because I was also just curious. The first thing I asked.

70
00:03:51,388 --> 00:03:58,548
PART.1: It's interesting that they will do a personal test afterwards. How should she behave?

71
00:03:58,748 --> 00:04:00,948
PART.2: How can we help her?

72
00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:04,788
PART.2: Don't we keep them for the next round?

73
00:04:04,868 --> 00:04:08,708
PART.1: No, there won't be a next round. Do you want to do a second round? Do you want to see me losing?

74
00:04:08,788 --> 00:04:11,388
PART.2: No but I thought there is a winner in two games.
