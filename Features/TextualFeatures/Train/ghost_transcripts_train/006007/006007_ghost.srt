6
00:00:09,962 --> 00:00:10,962
PART.1: No?

7
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:13,562
PART.2: The chair?

8
00:00:13,562 --> 00:00:13,762
PART.1: Wait, wait, wait...

9
00:00:13,842 --> 00:00:13,962
PART.2: The chair?

10
00:00:13,962 --> 00:00:14,562
PART.1: Wait, wait, wait...

11
00:00:14,562 --> 00:00:17,962
PART.2: So there's no green bottle
and I think it's fine.

12
00:00:17,962 --> 00:00:20,162
PART.1: Do you think it is really?

13
00:00:20,162 --> 00:00:20,962
PART.2: Yes.

14
00:00:20,962 --> 00:00:21,082
PART.1: Because I am not 100% sure.

PART.2: So you keep the card.

17
00:00:22,242 --> 00:00:22,962
PART.1: Because I am not 100% sure.

18
00:00:22,962 --> 00:00:23,162
PART.1: Because I am not 100% sure.

19
00:00:23,442 --> 00:00:24,442
PART.1: Ok.

20
00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:25,842
PART.2: It is yours.

21
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:27,842
PART.1: Maybe we do it wrong,
you know?

22
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,842
PART.1: I guess is not the point.

23
00:00:33,162 --> 00:00:34,162
PART.2: This?

24
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,162
PART.1: Ah! You are right!
You are right!

25
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:41,162

PART.2: You keep it.

29
00:00:48,962 --> 00:00:52,362
PART.1: If we both think
it is the right answer
then it is going to be
the right answer.

30
00:00:52,842 --> 00:00:54,362
PART.2: Green, chair, blue, book.

00:00:58,122 --> 00:00:58,562
PART.1: I think you are good
at spotting the right ones!

34
00:00:58,562 --> 00:00:58,842
PART.2: The right ones?

35
00:00:58,962 --> 00:01:00,842

PART.1: Yes, I accept it.

45
00:01:25,362 --> 00:01:26,042

00:01:31,762 --> 00:01:33,762
PART.1: Yes, I think so, you.

49
00:01:39,362 --> 00:01:41,842
PART.2: Why do you always get
the blue book ones?

50
00:01:42,642 --> 00:01:46,162
PART.1: You are just lucky enough
for the blue book, oh my God!

51
00:01:53,842 --> 00:01:57,042
PART.1: There is no white in this picture
and the grey is the mouse.

52
00:01:57,042 --> 00:01:59,842
PART.2: Yes, you are right
so you win.

53
00:01:59,842 --> 00:02:00,002

yes, there is.

54
00:02:00,082 --> 00:02:00,242
PART.2: Yes, you are right
so you win.

55
00:02:00,242 --> 00:02:02,242

00:02:19,242 --> 00:02:20,762
PART.2: There is the grey and the mouse.

62
00:02:20,962 --> 00:02:24,242
PART.1: Yes, yes,
because there is no blue in this
and there is no book in this.

63
00:02:25,242 --> 00:02:26,242
PART.1: Last one...

64
00:02:31,362 --> 00:02:32,362

some of those
are not from the training session?

00:02:48,762 --> 00:02:50,162
PART.1: How do you have seven?

75
00:02:50,162 --> 00:02:52,162
PART.2: I think I've got the most
of the blue books.

76
00:02:52,362 --> 00:02:54,562
PART.1: I think you've got
all the blue books.

77
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,042

for the blue books.

79
00:03:04,362 --> 00:03:10,042
PART.1: Actually a friend of mine
has this game
and she told me several times to play it.

80
00:03:10,962 --> 00:03:14,042
PART.1: It's like fun
because it's like so stressful

81
00:03:14,122 --> 00:03:16,562
PART.1: because you have to pay attention
and so on.

82
00:03:16,562 --> 00:03:17,962
PART.2: The odd one is the most tricky.

83
00:03:17,962 --> 00:03:18,402
PART.1: Once you play it a bit
you have to kind of remember
a bit the answers
when you get used to it.

84
00:03:18,482 --> 00:03:18,642
PART.2: The odd one is the most tricky.

85
00:03:18,642 --> 00:03:25,242
PART.1: Once you play it a bit
you have to kind of remember
a bit the answers
when you get used to it.

86
00:03:26,962 --> 00:03:28,842
PART.1: But I have never tried this game.

87
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:36,162
PART.2: We should play
more games like this,
we could buy this for the camping.

88
00:03:36,962 --> 00:03:43,242
PART.1: Yes, actually I have to ask them
if they want to come.

89
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:44,962
PART.2: Who?

90
00:03:44,962 --> 00:03:47,842
PART.1: This friend of mine
is Hungarian and also her boyfriend.

91
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,442
PART.1: Yes, I should probably
ask them as well.

92
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:54,042
PART.1: Yes, this is really fun
because it doesn't take much space.

93
00:03:55,362 --> 00:03:57,962
PART.2: Is it for two people only
or it can be played by many more?

94
00:03:57,962 --> 00:03:58,482
PART.1: No, I think more
and the most stressful it gets
the more people that are.

95
00:03:58,562 --> 00:03:58,962
PART.2: Is it for two people only
or it can be played by many more?

96
00:03:58,962 --> 00:04:04,962
PART.1: No, I think more
and the most stressful it gets
the more people that are.

97
00:04:04,962 --> 00:04:06,962

98
00:04:07,242 --> 00:04:08,242
