PART.2: You take it, yes.

36
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:29,987

00:02:04,387 --> 00:02:06,467
PART.1: He didn't explain,
I don't know,

00:02:06,547 --> 00:02:08,547
PART.1: he didn't explain the rules
the first time

59
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:10,707
PART.1: and what happens if you take
the wrong one?

60
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:14,707
PART.2: I guess is like who picks
the right one first.

61
00:02:14,707 --> 00:02:17,947
PART.1: I don't know,
I asked my friend

62
00:02:18,027 --> 00:02:22,387
PART.1: and she is like it becomes
like the other person's turn.

63
00:02:22,387 --> 00:02:26,187
PART.1: And you just have to wait,
I guess, but is like he wins anyway.

64
00:02:27,187 --> 00:02:28,187
PART.1: Anyway...

65
00:02:29,987 --> 00:02:30,987

PART.2: Yes, I also did.

79
00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:51,627
PART.1: When I played with my friend
she was really bad at it

80
00:02:51,707 --> 00:02:51,867
PART.1: to the point that I was like just
waiting for her to pick the right one.

81
00:02:51,947 --> 00:02:51,987
PART.2: Yes, I also did.

82
00:02:51,987 --> 00:02:56,987
PART.1: When I played with my friend
she was really bad at it
to the point

83
00:02:57,067 --> 00:03:00,907

waiting for her to pick the right one.

84
00:03:00,907 --> 00:03:04,707
PART.1: Come on!
Just pick the correct one!

85
00:03:05,907 --> 00:03:07,987
PART.1: But it is a nice game,
I don't know how is it called.

86
00:03:08,507 --> 00:03:11,027
PART.2: In the last one,
for some reason,

87
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:15,787
PART.2: there was this blue book
a lot of times so I was always
looking for the blue book.

88
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:16,387
PART.1: Always!

89
00:03:16,387 --> 00:03:16,547
