1
00:00:01,591 --> 00:00:02,591
PART.1: Do you want to try it first?

2
00:00:03,511 --> 00:00:04,991
PART.2: It doesn't matter, it's ok.

3
00:00:05,591 --> 00:00:06,991
PART.1: Ok, let's see.

4
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:12,991
PART.1: Is it right?

5
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:15,391
PART.1: It makes sense, right?

6
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:15,711
PART.2: Yes, it makes sense,
there is no blue
and there is no... Yes.

7
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:15,911
PART.1: It makes sense, right?

8
00:00:15,911 --> 00:00:18,311
PART.2: Yes, it makes sense,

00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:26,791
PART.1: No?

11
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:28,791
PART.2: I think so, yes.

12
00:00:29,391 --> 00:00:31,591
PART.1: You have to play
like with your mind.

13
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:39,791
PART.2: It makes sense
because this is a book,
this is red, this is green
and the mouse is grey, sure.

14
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:45,311
PART.2: It's mind blowing for me!

00:00:46,911 --> 00:00:47,911

00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:49,511
PART.2: Ok...

17
00:00:49,511 --> 00:00:49,951

to make it.

18
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:50,191
PART.2: Ok...

19
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:52,591
PART.1: They were too close
to make it.

20
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:55,311
PART.2: I was happy
because I've seen it.

21
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:00,191
PART.2: Ok, sure.

22
00:01:00,191 --> 00:01:00,591
PART.1: Is it?

23
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:01,191
PART.2: Ok, sure.

24
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:04,791
PART.1: Well, I did before
so that's why...

25
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,391
PART.2: But I am really bad at this.

26
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,111
PART.2: Yes!

27
00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:13,791
PART.2: Sorry, I was going
to worry if lose to see that one.

28
00:01:14,511 --> 00:01:15,791
PART.2: So it's fine red now.

29
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:19,511
PART.1: You know, I am comfortable.

30
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:21,791
PART.2: Yes.

31
00:01:22,391 --> 00:01:24,511
PART.1: Yes, because the mouse is white.

32
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:26,511
PART.1: Right? It is not grey.

33
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:28,511
PART.1: Yes, ok.

34
00:01:33,911 --> 00:01:34,911
PART.1: Yes, yes.

35
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:43,191
PART.1: Book?

36
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:45,791
PART.2: But was it a chair?

37
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:48,511
PART.1: No, actually monster white.

38
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:50,511
PART.2: That's right! That is why!

39
00:01:50,591 --> 00:01:52,191
PART.2: But you told me now.

40
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:55,791
PART.1: No, but yes now is your turn.

41
00:01:56,311 --> 00:02:00,391
PART.2: I don't know, are you sure?
Because I haven't seen it.

42
00:02:01,191 --> 00:02:03,591
PART.1: No, no, it is yours,
mine was wrong.

43
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:07,311
PART.2: But I should have guessed it
and I was not sure but ok.

44
00:02:09,191 --> 00:02:10,791
PART.2: It is right, ok.

45
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,791
PART.1: Ok, let's see...

46
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:17,511
PART.2: Ok, and now we are prepared
for those if you don't mind.

47
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:19,511
PART.1: Yes, yes.

48
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,911
PART.2: Well, I was wrong anyway.

49
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,191
PART.1: Because you were going to take...

50
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:29,191
PART.2: I wanted to take this
but no, this is the chair.

51
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,191
PART.1: Yes, let's see...

52
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:34,791
PART.1: Yes.

53
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:37,711
PART.2: Ok, I get it!

54
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:41,991
PART.1: I did it first
so that's why...

55
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:51,991
PART.2: But still I am not sure,
I am very challenging for me,
I am just guessing
what would you like
and then is this
because of this and this.

56
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:57,711
PART.2: But there is no greens,
there is no bottle, maybe,
but you are not like
really sure about it.

57
00:02:59,191 --> 00:03:02,591
PART.1: Yes, you are like afraid
to take the decisions.

58
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,271
PART.1: I was waiting,
in the meantime,

59
00:03:06,351 --> 00:03:10,911
PART.1: for this next session

on the Internet to buy it.

60
00:03:10,911 --> 00:03:13,191
PART.1: To buy it for my nephew
or something.

61
00:03:13,591 --> 00:03:14,791
PART.2: It is really good.

62
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,751

63
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,391
PART.1: this is interesting,
I have never seen it.

64
00:03:20,391 --> 00:03:23,951
PART.2: It is really different
from other games I've known

65
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:29,191
PART.2: but usually I am not sure
if you cover as a tactic
like we can go
through these ones maybe

66
00:03:29,271 --> 00:03:31,911
PART.2: and then compare it
or go maybe what can I see

67
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:32,311
PART.1: But it is going to be like that.

68
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:33,071
PART.2: I am not sure which is better.

69
00:03:33,151 --> 00:03:33,911
PART.1: But it is going to be like that.
