And some tail. Or something like this. 
Okay. 
I can go in the water. 
Do I have wings? 
Oh ok. 
Okay. 
No. 
I think so. I'm not sure. I'm sure you don't eat a banana. 
I think I know what it eats maybe. 
I have no wings. 
No wings. So I can also live on the water so I can go in the water and swim a bit? So I have something to swim? 
Okay.
