We had land, we had... What was I asking afterwards? 
We have four, okay. 
Because also you only ask four things. I think it's only four maybe. 
Because you asked how many foot, how may feet... 
Banana, different colours... 
And a lizard, yeah, four. Okay, okay. 
It's my turn? 
Or are you going to ask some thing else then lizard maybe. I‚Äôm not sure. 
It‚Äôs not written lizard, it's something else written. I'm sure it's one... 
Yeah pretty close, I'm not sure what. 
Lizard doesn't change its color I think.
