A bear and it was saying if the mother has milk or not and I was like... He knows the word for it and I was like what is it.
He was describing it and I was like I have no idea. Another question was another question was like. Does it have a tail?I think a small one but I'm not sure about it.
And does it sleep in the winter? 
Same. I was also like guessing. But I was always like take another question, I have no idea.
