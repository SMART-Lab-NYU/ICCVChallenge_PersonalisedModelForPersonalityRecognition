No it's OK. ... I know I have no idea. You can go. 
Oh shit I mixed something up. It's my fault. Is it? 
I thought. Is this animal changing? 
No, no. 
Yeah. I'm not... There is another one but maybe it's not changing the color. Sorry I'm looking at the picture and trying to figure out if it's changing the color right now. 
...Right now? Is there a movie up on my head? 
Maybe you don't know the name because you've got everything. 
Let's guess a bit better. I think it changes its color. 
OK we had to before. I had forgot. That's not true.
