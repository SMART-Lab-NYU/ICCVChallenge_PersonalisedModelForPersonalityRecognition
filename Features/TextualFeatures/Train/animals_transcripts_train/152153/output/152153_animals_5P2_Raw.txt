I said land and then you ask me if I can swim? And then if it's all the same color and then if it's lives near the sea. 
It is four questions? 
How many feet. And I also asked different colours. 
And if I'm a lizard. 
So four questions. 
My question again... 
Your turn? 
No, your turn, I asked. 
Is it close to it? 
I don't know...
