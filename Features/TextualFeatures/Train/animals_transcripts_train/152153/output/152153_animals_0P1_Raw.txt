Okay. 
So do you want to do it like each question. 
OK yeah. So should you start or I start? 
OK. Do I live on the land? It's like in the land, in the water or air? I'm asking you do I live on land? 
That's interesting. Thank you. 
I heard other stuff and was like shoot, I don't know. 
Okay. 
How many? 
Oh yeah sure. 
Four legs. 
And maybe I can extend it a bit more and... I'm not sure. 
Let me say four legs and something to hold on.
