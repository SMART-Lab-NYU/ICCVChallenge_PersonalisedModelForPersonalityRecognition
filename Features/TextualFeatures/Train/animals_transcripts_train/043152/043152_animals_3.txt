00:03:11,354 --> 00:03:16,234

do I live like in Africa?

64
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:21,954
PART.2: No, I don't think so,
it is not African
and you can find it in Europe a lot.

00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:27,954

It was now not a lot anymore

00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:38,234

72
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:49,234

00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:51,434
