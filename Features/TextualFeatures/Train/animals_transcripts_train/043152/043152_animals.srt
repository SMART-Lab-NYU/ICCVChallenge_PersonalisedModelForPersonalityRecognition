PART.2: I think so, sorry.

24
00:01:01,434 --> 00:01:05,034
PART.2: Let me get one more question
because I didn't finish so well this.

25
00:01:06,354 --> 00:01:07,754
PART.1: Well, let's do another one.

26
00:01:07,754 --> 00:01:08,754
PART.2: Ok.

27
00:01:10,034 --> 00:01:14,234
PART.1: I don't know,
is it possible to see me in the zoo?

28
00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:15,234

00:01:15,514 --> 00:01:15,634
PART.2: Yes.

31
00:01:15,634 --> 00:01:17,634
PART.1: Yes, ok, good.

32
00:01:17,754 --> 00:01:19,834
PART.2: Do I live in the water?

33
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:20,834
PART.1: No.

34
00:01:20,954 --> 00:01:21,954
PART.2: Ok.

35
00:01:22,754 --> 00:01:26,354
PART.2: There is one left
but it is one less question.

36
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:28,954
PART.1: A second question, let's see...

37
00:01:32,234 --> 00:01:36,234
PART.1: Is it possible to eat?
Do people usually eat it or not?

38
00:01:36,234 --> 00:01:43,034
PART.2: Usually not...
I think when it is hunted
you can eat it afterwards,

39
00:01:43,114 --> 00:01:48,354
PART.2: but if it was hunted before
because of something else maybe.

40
00:01:48,354 --> 00:01:51,354
PART.2: I am not sure, it is meat,
you can eat every animal?

41
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:56,634
PART.2: But it is not typical,
when I go to a restaurant
I would never eat it,
so there is not need of it.

42
00:01:57,234 --> 00:01:58,634
PART.1: Ok, ok.

43
00:01:59,634 --> 00:02:02,634
PART.2: Ok, so I live in the air?

44
00:02:02,954 --> 00:02:03,954
PART.1: Yes.

45
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:04,234
PART.2: Ok.

46
00:02:04,314 --> 00:02:04,634

47
00:02:04,634 --> 00:02:04,954
PART.2: Ok.

48
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:06,954
PART.1: Definitely, ok?

49
00:02:10,954 --> 00:02:12,554
PART.1: Let me see...

50
00:02:14,554 --> 00:02:16,634
PART.1: I don't like this game.

51
00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:20,594
PART.2: I have never played it
only with ten questions,

52
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:23,634
PART.2: I can usually ask
as many questions as I want,
but then it was ok.

53
00:02:23,634 --> 00:02:26,634
PART.1: Yes, I mean,
I am not a good guesser.

54
00:02:26,634 --> 00:02:35,554
PART.1: Let's say, in the zoo,
we don't eat it,
am I like a big animal?

55
00:02:36,234 --> 00:02:40,834
PART.2: Yes, it is a big animal
for my opinion, yes,
it is bigger than me.

56
00:02:40,834 --> 00:02:42,354
PART.1: Ok, good.

57
00:02:43,154 --> 00:02:44,354
PART.2: I have wings?

00:02:45,354 --> 00:02:47,554
PART.1: Yes, you do have wings.

59
00:02:47,754 --> 00:02:51,754

00:02:52,754 --> 00:02:55,034

PART.1: I don't know,
do I live like in Africa?

64
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:21,954
PART.2: No, I don't think so,
it is not African
and you can find it in Europe a lot.

65
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:27,954
PART.2: Not a lot!
It was now not a lot anymore
but it was a lot before.

66
00:03:27,954 --> 00:03:29,954
PART.1: Ok, good, ok.

67
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:33,234
PART.2: Ok, am I a bird?

68
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:36,634
PART.1: Yes

69
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:38,234
PART.2: Do I have to guess which bird?

70
00:03:39,034 --> 00:03:44,034

00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:47,834
PART.2: Ok, ok, good to know.

72
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:49,234

00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:27,554
PART.2: because it is flying
but is it a duck?

186
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,354
