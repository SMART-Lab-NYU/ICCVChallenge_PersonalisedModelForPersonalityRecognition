24
00:01:01,434 --> 00:01:05,034
PART.2: Let me get one more question
because I didn't finish so well this.

25
00:01:06,354 --> 00:01:07,754
PART.1: Well, let's do another one.

26
00:01:07,754 --> 00:01:08,754
PART.2: Ok.

27
00:01:10,034 --> 00:01:14,234
PART.1: I don't know,
is it possible to see me in the zoo?

28
00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:15,234
PART.2: Yes.

29
00:01:15,234 --> 00:01:15,434
PART.1: Yes, ok, good.

30
00:01:15,514 --> 00:01:15,634
PART.2: Yes.

31
00:01:15,634 --> 00:01:17,634
PART.1: Yes, ok, good.

32
00:01:17,754 --> 00:01:19,834
PART.2: Do I live in the water?

33
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:20,834
PART.1: No.

34
00:01:20,954 --> 00:01:21,954
PART.2: Ok.

35
00:01:22,754 --> 00:01:26,354
PART.2: There is one left
but it is one less question.

36
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:28,954
PART.1: A second question, let's see...

37
00:01:32,234 --> 00:01:36,234
PART.1: Is it possible to eat?
Do people usually eat it or not?

38
00:01:36,234 --> 00:01:43,034
PART.2: Usually not...
I think when it is hunted
you can eat it afterwards,

39
00:01:43,114 --> 00:01:48,354
PART.2: but if it was hunted before
because of something else maybe.

40
00:01:48,354 --> 00:01:51,354
PART.2: I am not sure, it is meat,
you can eat every animal?

41
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:56,634
PART.2: But it is not typical,
when I go to a restaurant
I would never eat it,
so there is not need of it.

42
00:01:57,234 --> 00:01:58,634
PART.1: Ok, ok.

43
00:01:59,634 --> 00:02:02,634
PART.2: Ok, so I live in the air?
