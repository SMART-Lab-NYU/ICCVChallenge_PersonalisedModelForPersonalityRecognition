Let me get one more question because I didn't finish so well this.
Ok. 
Yes. 
Yes. 
Do I live in the water? 
Ok. 
There is one left but it is one less question.
Usually not... I think when it is huntedyou can eat it afterwards,
but if it was hunted before because of something else maybe.
I am not sure, it is meat, you can eat every animal?
But it is not typical, when I go to a restaurantI would never eat it,so there is not need of it.
Ok, so I live in the air?
