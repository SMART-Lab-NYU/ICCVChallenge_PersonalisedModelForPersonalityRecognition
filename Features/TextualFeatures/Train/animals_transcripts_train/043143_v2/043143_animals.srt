00:10:20,628 --> 00:10:22,188

00:10:40,028 --> 00:10:42,028
PART.2: You know just like these
small nuts?

178
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,468
PART.2: Or it's not...

179
00:10:43,788 --> 00:10:51,428
PART.1: I don't really know what
it eats but you can change your
question.

180
00:10:53,908 --> 00:10:54,588
PART.2: OK.

181
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:55,988
PART.2: Let me see then.

182
00:10:59,428 --> 00:11:01,908
PART.2: Does it have like long feathers?

183
00:11:03,188 --> 00:11:05,868
PART.2: A lot of like... er.

184
00:11:06,668 --> 00:11:09,588

00:11:13,308 --> 00:11:14,468
PART.1: Not very long.

189
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:23,748
PART.2: OK.

190
00:11:24,868 --> 00:11:26,588
PART.2: I'm gonna take a chance.

191
00:11:26,668 --> 00:11:28,468
PART.2: It's like a racoon or something?

192
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:35,388
PART.2: Or a racoon or like a "skirel"?

193
00:11:35,468 --> 00:11:37,508
PART.2: Or those kind of animals?

194
00:11:40,828 --> 00:11:45,028
PART.1: I don't say it's
like a racoon but...

195
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,668
PART.1: It's similar to racoon.

196
00:11:49,268 --> 00:11:50,988
PART.1: But it's not racoon or...

197
00:11:52,548 --> 00:11:58,708
PART.1: The behaviour is not like a
racoon...but... it's similar.

198
00:11:59,028 --> 00:11:59,868
PART.2: OK.

199
00:12:06,628 --> 00:12:07,948
PART.1: It's bigger than a
racoon.

200
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:08,828
PART.2: It's bigger.

201
00:12:10,348 --> 00:12:13,588
PART.1: And also I think that
racoons can hunt.

202
00:12:14,148 --> 00:12:14,948
PART.2: Yeah.

203
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:16,868
PART.1: But this one I think no.

204
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:17,788
PART.2: No.

205
00:12:20,548 --> 00:12:21,308
PART.2: OK.

206
00:12:23,988 --> 00:12:25,308
PART.2: Can't think...

207
00:12:33,588 --> 00:12:35,308
PART.2: It's bigger than a racoon...

208
00:12:43,668 --> 00:12:44,428
PART.2: Last question.

209
00:12:44,508 --> 00:12:45,508
PART.2: It's not a reptile?

210
00:12:45,908 --> 00:12:47,908
PART.2: Nothing about...no other, no.

211
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,268
PART.2: Far from that.

212
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:05,628
PART.2: I'm thinking something about
like between a racoon and a bear.

213
00:13:06,988 --> 00:13:10,668
PART.2: I was like trying to find
an animal...

214
00:13:11,428 --> 00:13:14,468
PART.1: But both of them can
hunt; this one no.

215
00:13:14,548 --> 00:13:15,188
PART.2: Yeah.

00:13:15,388 --> 00:13:17,468

00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,068
PART.1: You can find it...

219
00:13:26,228 --> 00:13:31,348
PART.1: It's not all over the world,
it's just in a part of the world.

220
00:13:34,588 --> 00:13:35,308
PART.2: Right.

221
00:13:41,868 --> 00:13:45,628
PART.2: And probably it's very specific
to one part of the world?

222
00:13:46,508 --> 00:13:47,788
PART.2: And people know that.

223
00:13:48,268 --> 00:13:50,548
PART.2: They know
it's from that specific part...

224
00:13:54,228 --> 00:13:55,068
PART.2: They like...

225
00:13:58,548 --> 00:14:03,668

00:14:19,188 --> 00:14:20,868
PART.1: It's living in Australia.

231
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,748
PART.1: I think now it's quite easy.

232
00:14:24,548 --> 00:14:25,228
PART.2: Yeah.

233
00:14:26,068 --> 00:14:26,588

PART.1: No.

237
00:14:36,868 --> 00:14:37,868
PART.1: It's not a kanagaroo.

238
00:14:38,308 --> 00:14:39,788
PART.1: Because kangaroo can hunt...

239
00:14:39,468 --> 00:14:40,188

00:14:58,708 --> 00:14:59,988
PART.1: It's really hard.

252
00:15:00,348 --> 00:15:02,228
PART.1: I think this one was harder
than this.

253
00:15:02,388 --> 00:15:02,948
PART.2: Uh huh.

254
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,148
