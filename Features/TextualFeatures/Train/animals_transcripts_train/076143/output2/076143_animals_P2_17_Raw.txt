It is big... 
So... 
The horn is not here, is here, so it is not an elephant.
Because it is not blue, because elephant is a kind of blue.
That is why I asked. 
It doesn't have a very long neck, which is a giraffe,so it is not a giraffe.
Because a giraffe has also horns. 
And those hasn't have a horn, it is not a kind of moose...
