Ok. 
Do I live in a hot place? 
Like I am a typically like... 
Like a hot, hot place. 
Like a hot, hot place. 
Ok, Jesus Christ, ok. 
So I am hairy, I am probably bigger than a cat
but you are not sure, I live more on land,
I have spine and I don't live in a hot place.
Now it is like a ten thousand species left.
Ok. 
I think I have five or six. 
Am I a hervibore?
