PART.2: When do they eat?

29
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:47,254

41
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,654
PART.2: I am thinking in my head
and I am not asking.

42
00:02:33,134 --> 00:02:41,054
PART.2: It is not a turtle,
it lives in the sea
but it can also come to the land
but mostly in the sea, wow...

00:02:59,654 --> 00:03:06,534
PART.2: It eats fishes
and it lives in the sea
and it can also be on land...

48
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:12,654
PART.2: In the sea,
it does not live in rivers?

49
00:03:13,654 --> 00:03:14,654
PART.1: Why...

50
00:03:15,254 --> 00:03:16,654
PART.2: Yes or no?

51
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:25,134
PART.1: It may...

52
00:03:26,854 --> 00:03:28,854
PART.2: It is not a yes
or no answer but ok.

53
00:03:28,854 --> 00:03:30,854
PART.1: It can, it can.

54
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:35,934
PART.1: It is not this close I would say.

55
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:39,334
PART.2: I have already a lot of questions.

56
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:42,854
PART.2: Does this...

57
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:49,454
PART.2: So, it is not a crocodile
because a crocodile don't eat fish,
I don't think so.

00:03:57,054 --> 00:03:58,054

PART.2: What?

67
00:04:11,454 --> 00:04:13,134
PART.1: How many questions
do you have left?

68
00:04:13,534 --> 00:04:15,654
PART.2: I think I am done,
I already have ten.

69
00:04:18,054 --> 00:04:20,254
PART.1: You can have one more guess
I would say.

70
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:27,854
PART.2: It is not a type of fish,
not a type of snake...

71
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:32,734
PART.2: What type of animals
are there then?

72
00:04:33,334 --> 00:04:40,214
PART.2: It is not a turtle, it eats fish
so it cannot be a crab,

73
00:04:40,294 --> 00:04:45,734
PART.2: it lives in the sea,
it can live mostly in the sea...

74
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:54,254
PART.1: I mean, maybe you have
to fight my answers
to be honest,

75
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:58,694
PART.1: so maybe they are not bad
so maybe I am wrong

76
00:04:58,774 --> 00:05:02,454
PART.1: and I didn't say
that live in the sea.

77
00:05:02,654 --> 00:05:06,734
PART.1: It is like around it.

78
00:05:07,654 --> 00:05:08,934
PART.2: It does not live in the sea?

sleep in the sea
if it is what you ask.

80
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:20,654

82
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:23,934

my life harder.

a bird that eats fish
and it is pretty famous.

93
00:06:04,734 --> 00:06:05,854

94
00:06:06,454 --> 00:06:09,254

your ten questions.

97
00:06:19,054 --> 00:06:21,134
PART.2: Maybe we start
with something I lost.

98
00:06:22,254 --> 00:06:30,934
PART.1: Ok, so let's try
to do mine and maybe
you can guess yours
in the meantime.

because I didn't see this animal
but I would say no.
