168
00:12:04,822 --> 00:12:07,121
PART.2: OK.

169
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,439
PART.1: It's bigger than a
racoon.

170
00:12:09,044 --> 00:12:11,343
PART.2: It's bigger.

171
00:12:10,707 --> 00:12:13,006
PART.2: And also I think that
racoons can hunt.

172
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:15,506
PART.2: Yeah.

173
00:12:15,706 --> 00:12:18,006

00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:23,006
PART.2: OK.

176
00:12:23,206 --> 00:12:25,506
PART.2: Can't think...

177
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,582
PART.2: It's bigger than a racoon...

178
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:49,610
PART.2: Last question. It's not a reptile?
Nothing about...no other, no.

179
00:12:49,772 --> 00:12:52,072
PART.2: Far from that.
