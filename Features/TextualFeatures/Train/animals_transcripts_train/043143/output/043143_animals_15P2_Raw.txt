Uh huh. Yeah, yeah. Should we...
Call 'em? 
We're here.... 
Koala... 
My first one was a fish. A dolphin. It was a dolphin.
And today. No. First one I did two interactions.
It was a dolphin and a bear. 
And I was able to find the dolphin but it was like easy....
Dolphin and bear...was like easy 
But the other one was... 
a bird. 
A bird that I have never heard of. And this.
But Meysam, when you did what was the...the other animal?
