PART.2: Let's have just a short view
and we can first, ok.

6
00:00:05,845 --> 00:00:10,165
PART.2: I would follow maybe a bit
and we can search

00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:10,565
PART.1: Ok, for the pieces, yes.

8
00:00:10,645 --> 00:00:11,565

00:00:15,045 --> 00:00:15,965
PART.1: Not, I am not a LEGO...

13
00:00:15,965 --> 00:00:16,525
PART.2: To use the best tactic,
I have only a little process,

14
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:17,005

00:00:47,245 --> 00:00:47,605
PART.2: Yes, that's good.

39
00:00:47,685 --> 00:00:48,245

00:00:59,165 --> 00:01:00,845

PART.2: This I put it down.

59
00:01:32,645 --> 00:01:34,645
PART.1: I think this goes...

60
00:01:37,645 --> 00:01:39,445
PART.1: Here and then
we need four of these!

61
00:01:39,645 --> 00:01:43,445

PART.1: Two, let's see...

90
00:02:53,645 --> 00:02:55,565
PART.2: But it is a different one,
it is like a closed one.

91
00:02:55,965 --> 00:02:57,245
PART.2: I am not sure
if there's an open eye.

92
00:02:57,245 --> 00:02:57,325
PART.1: This one is open.

93
00:02:57,405 --> 00:02:57,565
PART.2: I am not sure

PART.1: This one is open.

97
00:02:58,245 --> 00:02:58,645
PART.2: Ah, it's better.

PART.2: It looks good
so I will place it like this.

107
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:11,845
PART.2: We have it on the side, maybe?

108
00:03:13,165 --> 00:03:15,645
PART.2: Then we can put
the eyes on it.

109
00:03:17,645 --> 00:03:20,165
PART.2: And we have some... Yes.

110
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:21,765
PART.1: Yes and then...

111
00:03:21,765 --> 00:03:22,045
PART.2: Just move it
and turn it around again.

112
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:22,245
PART.1: Yes and then...

113
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:24,565
PART.2: Just move it
and turn it around again.

114
00:03:25,645 --> 00:03:26,045
PART.2: No, that's weird.

115
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:26,365
PART.1: Yes, it should be here I think.

116
00:03:26,445 --> 00:03:26,645
PART.2: No, that's weird.

117
00:03:26,645 --> 00:03:28,645

118
00:03:28,645 --> 00:03:30,645
PART.2: Yes, like this?

119
00:03:31,765 --> 00:03:33,845
PART.1: No, I think
is the other way around, yes!

120
00:03:34,445 --> 00:03:36,445
PART.2: Ah, it's looking down,
I remember, ok.

121
00:03:36,445 --> 00:03:40,565
PART.2: It is like this,
I was like it should be up
but it is ok, maybe.

122
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:44,245
PART.1: This is eight and nine,
let's see.

123
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:47,045
PART.1: Two black.

124
00:03:47,845 --> 00:03:51,045
PART.2: Yes, this one
is already collected.

125
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,965
PART.1: Yes, it is like
getting easy for us.

126
00:03:53,965 --> 00:03:55,165
PART.2: But we need this one.

127
00:03:55,165 --> 00:04:02,445
PART.1: Yes, these LEGOs are more...
On my time it was not like this.

128
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:05,045
PART.2: But you had it as a toy?

129
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:13,245
PART.1: Well, we used to have LEGOs
as well but not this one,
this one is very like modern I think.

130
00:04:13,245 --> 00:04:14,245
PART.2: Yes, yes.

131
00:04:14,245 --> 00:04:15,245
PART.1: Mines are like...

132
00:04:15,245 --> 00:04:19,165
PART.2: Usually you had playing stuff
and you had to be creative,
like having eyes?

133
00:04:19,245 --> 00:04:20,445
PART.2: I've never seen it before.

134
00:04:20,445 --> 00:04:24,645
PART.1: That's right,
that's when I say
they are like modern.

135
00:04:26,445 --> 00:04:27,845
PART.1: And then we have...

136
00:04:27,845 --> 00:04:29,245
PART.2: Some green ones...

137
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:29,325
PART.1: Yes, some grass I think.

138
00:04:29,405 --> 00:04:29,445
PART.2: Some green ones...

139
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:31,445
PART.1: Yes, some grass I think.

140
00:04:32,445 --> 00:04:33,445
PART.1: Not this one...

141
00:04:33,965 --> 00:04:36,045
PART.1: Here and here.

142
00:04:36,165 --> 00:04:38,765
PART.1: Right, but I think
there is like foot...

143
00:04:38,765 --> 00:04:39,125
PART.2: And we put it like this,
like it is eating...

144
00:04:39,205 --> 00:04:39,565
PART.1: Right, but I think
there is like foot...

145
00:04:39,565 --> 00:04:41,845
PART.2: And we put it like this,
like it is eating...

146
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:43,845
PART.1: It is like, yes...

147
00:04:43,845 --> 00:04:45,845
PART.2: Is it like fitting like this?

148
00:04:46,165 --> 00:04:47,845
PART.1: But I think...

149
00:04:47,845 --> 00:04:49,845
PART.2: It looks good I think.

150
00:04:49,845 --> 00:04:50,845
PART.2: It looks similar.

151
00:04:50,845 --> 00:04:54,245
PART.1: Yes, it looks similar
but this seems
that there isn't more space here?

152
00:04:54,245 --> 00:04:54,325
PART.2: Is it higher here?
Because this one don't look like,
it can't fit on it at all...

153
00:04:54,405 --> 00:04:54,445
PART.1: Yes, it looks similar
but this seems
that there isn't more space here?

154
00:04:54,445 --> 00:05:00,445
PART.2: Is it higher here?
Because this one don't look like,
it can't fit on it at all...

155
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:02,965
PART.1: Yes, what...

156
00:05:09,645 --> 00:05:11,045
PART.1: Maybe there is something here.

157
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:13,245
PART.1: See? There's no space here?

158
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:15,445
PART.2: Oh, there's no space...

159
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:20,565
PART.2: We should have placed it there.

160
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,765
PART.1: Yes, here is...

161
00:05:27,565 --> 00:05:30,645
PART.2: This must be same heigh as...

162
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:32,245
PART.2: These are brown...

163
00:05:39,765 --> 00:05:40,765
PART.2: Like this.

164
00:05:43,045 --> 00:05:43,445
PART.2: And this must be one for it.

165
00:05:43,445 --> 00:05:43,925
PART.1: Yes, definitely yes.

166
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:44,645
PART.2: And this must be one for it.

167
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,245
PART.1: Yes, definitely yes.

168
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:48,245
PART.2: That looks good.

169
00:05:52,765 --> 00:05:58,045
PART.2: It makes me more sense,
before it was ourselves
putting them on the floor.

170
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:02,165
PART.1: Yes, now is more like that.

171
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:06,965
PART.2: Like this though,
that looks good
because it is placed like this.

172
00:06:06,965 --> 00:06:08,245
PART.2: Beautiful!

173
00:06:08,845 --> 00:06:14,485
PART.1: Yes, but do we have
to take pieces
or just the same pieces

174
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:17,765
PART.1: but they were like
in a brown position?

175
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:19,765
PART.2: I don't get it, sorry.

176
00:06:19,845 --> 00:06:26,765
PART.1: I was saying like it was wrong
because we misplaced the pieces.

177
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:30,845
PART.2: Yes, I really think...
Let's have a look.

178
00:06:32,445 --> 00:06:35,845
PART.2: That was this weird moment.

179
00:06:35,965 --> 00:06:40,325
PART.2: This weird moment
where we were asked if we...

180
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:45,365
PART.2: No, it is a shoulder,
it should be connected
this one to this one.

181
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:47,565
PART.2: I haven't seen it then.

182
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:47,645
PART.1: Ok, ok.

183
00:06:47,725 --> 00:06:47,965
PART.2: I haven't seen it then.

184
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:48,565
PART.1: Ok, ok.

185
00:06:49,165 --> 00:06:52,565
PART.2: Then afterwards
we could have seen it

186
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:57,205
PART.2: because then I just ignored it
because it is brown
and not all...

187
00:06:57,285 --> 00:06:58,245
PART.2: But it is ok.

188
00:06:58,245 --> 00:06:58,405
PART.1: Ah, not the same color.

189
00:06:58,485 --> 00:06:58,725
PART.2: Then afterwards
we could have seen it

190
00:06:58,805 --> 00:06:59,125
PART.2: because then I just ignored it
because it is brown
and not all...

191
00:06:59,205 --> 00:06:59,245
PART.2: But it is ok.

192
00:06:59,245 --> 00:06:59,765
PART.1: Ah, not the same color.

193
00:06:59,765 --> 00:07:03,565
PART.2: Oh, we found a mistake
and now it's done.

194
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:09,045
PART.1: Oh, we just learn
from the "mistakes".

195
00:07:09,165 --> 00:07:13,565
PART.2: Next time I play LEGO
I will be much better, sure.

196
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:18,445
PART.1: But in my time it was different,
like faces like this? No way...

197
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:20,245
PART.2: No, this is very special.

198
00:07:20,245 --> 00:07:25,005
PART.2: You can reuse it,
I mean, it is only possible
to build it like this

199
00:07:25,085 --> 00:07:27,645
PART.2: but you can use it
for maybe a sword or...

200
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:29,045
PART.1: Yes, yes.

201
00:07:29,045 --> 00:07:34,645
PART.2: But I think we don't need
to be more creative anymore,
just follow this.

202
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:40,365
PART.1: Yes, that's it,
because I was like remembering

203
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:49,845
PART.1: and I don't know
if they still have to follow the order,
so sometimes you just have
like pieces to invent.

204
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:49,965
PART.2: To put them together.

205
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:50,245
PART.1: Yes, that's it,
because I was like remembering

206
00:07:50,325 --> 00:07:50,765
PART.1: and I don't know
if they still have to follow the order,
so sometimes you just have
like pieces to invent.

207
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:50,965
PART.2: To put them together.

208
00:07:50,965 --> 00:07:52,965
PART.1: Yes, just like to be creative.

209
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:57,125
PART.2: After some time,
you need to be creative I think

210
00:07:57,205 --> 00:07:59,685
PART.2: because you just mix
every package together

211
00:07:59,765 --> 00:08:05,165
PART.2: and you are just
like you don't find
anything anymore so you have a look
a pick another color

212
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:08,765
PART.1: To make something different, yes.

213
00:08:08,765 --> 00:08:10,765
PART.1: Yes, LEGO is like everywhere.

214
00:08:10,965 --> 00:08:14,885
PART.2: But there is amazing things
with electric LEGOs
and big ones,

215
00:08:14,965 --> 00:08:17,845
PART.2: I have a little brother
who was working for two weeks

216
00:08:17,925 --> 00:08:22,165
PART.2: and sitting there putting things together
until it was like this big machine.

217
00:08:22,245 --> 00:08:30,845
PART.1: Yes, you can view like cities
with all the lights
and of course they have
the Star Wars LEGO.

218
00:08:30,965 --> 00:08:32,845
PART.2: Oh, sure...

219
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:36,045
PART.2: But usually
you don't play with it,
I have never seen someone...

220
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,365
PART.2: You just build it and then is like
dust on the shelf.

221
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:38,965
PART.1: Yes, for the creation,
just for the creation.

222
00:08:39,045 --> 00:08:39,805
PART.2: But usually
you don't play with it,
I have never seen someone...

223
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:40,445
PART.2: You just build it and then is like
dust on the shelf.

224
00:08:40,445 --> 00:08:42,045
PART.1: Yes, for the creation,
just for the creation.

225
00:08:42,165 --> 00:08:42,245
PART.2: So, look at this!

226
00:08:42,245 --> 00:08:42,885
SUPERVISOR: All right, perfect!
