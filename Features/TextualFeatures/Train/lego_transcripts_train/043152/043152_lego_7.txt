194
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:09,045
PART.1: Oh, we just learn
from the "mistakes".

195
00:07:09,165 --> 00:07:13,565
PART.2: Next time I play LEGO
I will be much better, sure.

196
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:18,445
PART.1: But in my time it was different,
like faces like this? No way...

197
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:20,245
PART.2: No, this is very special.

198
00:07:20,245 --> 00:07:25,005
PART.2: You can reuse it,
I mean, it is only possible
to build it like this

199
00:07:25,085 --> 00:07:27,645
PART.2: but you can use it
for maybe a sword or...

200
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:29,045
PART.1: Yes, yes.

201
00:07:29,045 --> 00:07:34,645
PART.2: But I think we don't need
to be more creative anymore,
just follow this.

202
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:40,365
PART.1: Yes, that's it,
because I was like remembering

203
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:49,845
PART.1: and I don't know
if they still have to follow the order,
so sometimes you just have
like pieces to invent.

204
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:49,965
PART.2: To put them together.

205
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:50,245
PART.1: Yes, that's it,
because I was like remembering

206
00:07:50,325 --> 00:07:50,765
PART.1: and I don't know
if they still have to follow the order,
so sometimes you just have
like pieces to invent.

207
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:50,965
PART.2: To put them together.

208
00:07:50,965 --> 00:07:52,965
PART.1: Yes, just like to be creative.

209
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:57,125
PART.2: After some time,
you need to be creative I think

210
00:07:57,205 --> 00:07:59,685
PART.2: because you just mix
every package together

211
00:07:59,765 --> 00:08:05,165
PART.2: and you are just
like you don't find
anything anymore so you have a look
a pick another color
