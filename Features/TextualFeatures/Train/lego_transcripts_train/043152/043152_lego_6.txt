171
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:06,965
PART.2: Like this though,
that looks good
because it is placed like this.

172
00:06:06,965 --> 00:06:08,245
PART.2: Beautiful!

173
00:06:08,845 --> 00:06:14,485
PART.1: Yes, but do we have
to take pieces
or just the same pieces

174
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:17,765
PART.1: but they were like
in a brown position?

175
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:19,765
PART.2: I don't get it, sorry.

176
00:06:19,845 --> 00:06:26,765
PART.1: I was saying like it was wrong
because we misplaced the pieces.

177
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:30,845
PART.2: Yes, I really think...
Let's have a look.

178
00:06:32,445 --> 00:06:35,845
PART.2: That was this weird moment.

179
00:06:35,965 --> 00:06:40,325
PART.2: This weird moment
where we were asked if we...

180
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:45,365
PART.2: No, it is a shoulder,
it should be connected
this one to this one.

181
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:47,565
PART.2: I haven't seen it then.

182
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:47,645
PART.1: Ok, ok.

183
00:06:47,725 --> 00:06:47,965
PART.2: I haven't seen it then.

184
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:48,565
PART.1: Ok, ok.

185
00:06:49,165 --> 00:06:52,565
PART.2: Then afterwards
we could have seen it

186
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:57,205
PART.2: because then I just ignored it
because it is brown
and not all...

187
00:06:57,285 --> 00:06:58,245
PART.2: But it is ok.

188
00:06:58,245 --> 00:06:58,405
PART.1: Ah, not the same color.

189
00:06:58,485 --> 00:06:58,725
PART.2: Then afterwards
we could have seen it

190
00:06:58,805 --> 00:06:59,125
PART.2: because then I just ignored it
because it is brown
and not all...

191
00:06:59,205 --> 00:06:59,245
PART.2: But it is ok.

192
00:06:59,245 --> 00:06:59,765
PART.1: Ah, not the same color.

193
00:06:59,765 --> 00:07:03,565
PART.2: Oh, we found a mistake
and now it's done.
