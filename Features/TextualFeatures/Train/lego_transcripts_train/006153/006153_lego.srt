1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,567
PART.2: This is it
and we can start forward
with the blue one and then orange.

2
00:00:05,567 --> 00:00:07,367
PART.1: Is this one? I think so.

3
00:00:08,567 --> 00:00:09,767
PART.1: Yes, it's this one.

4
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:14,847
PART.1: So, we are starting
with the piece of blue.

5
00:00:18,767 --> 00:00:20,247
PART.2: Then the yellow...

6
00:00:23,047 --> 00:00:24,047
PART.2: Ok.

7
00:00:25,247 --> 00:00:26,767
PART.1: And then more...

8
00:00:27,247 --> 00:00:28,767
PART.2: Another yellow?

9
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:30,767
PART.2: This one?

10
00:00:31,647 --> 00:00:32,767
PART.2: Or is it orange?

11
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:35,967
PART.1: I don't know,
there's another yellow here also.

12
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:40,967
PART.2: Yes, because on top
I think the first one
is orange and then yellow.

13
00:00:41,447 --> 00:00:46,247
PART.1: Maybe, of course one orange
and the two yellow above.

14
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:48,367
PART.1: But in the other way.

15
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:50,367
PART.2: Oh, yes, that's true.

16
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:54,247
PART.1: And we need two more yellow
and here is one.

17
00:00:59,447 --> 00:01:00,247
PART.1: Maybe that one?

18
00:01:00,247 --> 00:01:00,287
PART.2: Yes.

19
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:00,447
PART.1: Maybe that one?

20
00:01:00,447 --> 00:01:01,247
PART.2: Yes.

21
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:04,167
PART.1: Cool, now we know one...

22
00:01:04,767 --> 00:01:05,367
PART.2: Then grey.

23
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:07,367
PART.1: Yes, a small grey one.

24
00:01:09,247 --> 00:01:12,847
PART.1: I don't know,
is it grey or is it black?

25
00:01:12,847 --> 00:01:13,847
PART.1: I saw one black.

26
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:15,847
PART.2: It could be a black, yes-

27
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:21,647
PART.1: And then with this blue?

28
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:26,247
PART.2: But there's like a grey one with...

29
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:37,167
PART.2: Just the black
and the grey, yes.

30
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:38,447
PART.1: I think it's that one.

31
00:01:38,647 --> 00:01:40,447
PART.2: Yes, it's this.

32
00:01:47,247 --> 00:01:48,247
PART.1: Ok, this blue.

33
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:56,567
PART.2: Is it also in the station?
No, here.

34
00:01:56,567 --> 00:02:01,647
PART.1: Yes, and then I think
there is this one and it's too
small!

35
00:02:01,647 --> 00:02:02,647
PART.2: But...

36
00:02:03,047 --> 00:02:04,247
PART.1: Ah, and the other one.

PART.1: That's it,
do you want to do another one?

41
00:02:23,647 --> 00:02:25,367
PART.1: That's it,
do you want to do another one?

it is not rounded.

PART.2: Yes, this.

72
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:22,767

00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:25,167
PART.2: Yes, the small brown.

74
00:03:27,247 --> 00:03:29,047

this one goes in the middle.

00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:30,767
PART.2: Ok.

76
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,847
PART.1: And then you have this green
on one side of the...

77
00:03:32,847 --> 00:03:33,007
PART.2: But the first here,
the light brown goes on top.

00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:33,247
PART.1: And then you have this green
on one side of the...

79
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:35,247
