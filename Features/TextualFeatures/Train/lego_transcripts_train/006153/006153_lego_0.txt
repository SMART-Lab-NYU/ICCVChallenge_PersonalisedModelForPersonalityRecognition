1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,567
PART.2: This is it
and we can start forward
with the blue one and then orange.

2
00:00:05,567 --> 00:00:07,367
PART.1: Is this one? I think so.

3
00:00:08,567 --> 00:00:09,767
PART.1: Yes, it's this one.

4
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:14,847
PART.1: So, we are starting
with the piece of blue.

5
00:00:18,767 --> 00:00:20,247
PART.2: Then the yellow...

6
00:00:23,047 --> 00:00:24,047
PART.2: Ok.

7
00:00:25,247 --> 00:00:26,767
PART.1: And then more...

8
00:00:27,247 --> 00:00:28,767
PART.2: Another yellow?

9
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:30,767
PART.2: This one?

10
00:00:31,647 --> 00:00:32,767
PART.2: Or is it orange?

11
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:35,967
PART.1: I don't know,
there's another yellow here also.

12
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:40,967
PART.2: Yes, because on top
I think the first one
is orange and then yellow.

13
00:00:41,447 --> 00:00:46,247
PART.1: Maybe, of course one orange
and the two yellow above.

14
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:48,367
PART.1: But in the other way.

15
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:50,367
PART.2: Oh, yes, that's true.

16
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:54,247
PART.1: And we need two more yellow
and here is one.

17
00:00:59,447 --> 00:01:00,247
PART.1: Maybe that one?
