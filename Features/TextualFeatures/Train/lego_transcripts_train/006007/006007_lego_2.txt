00:02:16,996 --> 00:02:21,916
PART.1: Yes, I think
that is the wheel,
that black part.

80
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:25,996
PART.2: Oh, yes, that's true,
so it will go between.

PART.2: Ok.

00:02:36,396 --> 00:02:42,996
PART.2: And there should be
something after this wheel.

86
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,996

87
00:02:44,996 --> 00:02:45,396

92
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:53,516
PART.2: And the other one
will go behind I suppose?

93
00:02:54,116 --> 00:02:59,116
PART.1: Maybe like this
because this looks like a wheel
like this maybe?

94
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:03,116
PART.1: Because it has like hole
for a wheel, no?
