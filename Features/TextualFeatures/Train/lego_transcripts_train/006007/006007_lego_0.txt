1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,996
PART.1: So, do you want first
to find the right pieces?

2
00:00:02,996 --> 00:00:03,036
PART.2: Yes!

3
00:00:03,116 --> 00:00:03,396
PART.1: So, do you want first
to find the right pieces?

4
00:00:03,396 --> 00:00:03,996
PART.2: Yes!

5
00:00:03,996 --> 00:00:07,596
PART.1: Ok, this looks
like a piece for the car.

6
00:00:07,596 --> 00:00:08,596
PART.2: Yes, this thing.

7
00:00:08,796 --> 00:00:11,796
PART.1: Then we need to find
another one for the same kind.

8
00:00:12,516 --> 00:00:13,796
PART.2: Yes.

9
00:00:14,316 --> 00:00:19,796
PART.1: Ups, let's try and put
all the things all over the table.

10
00:00:20,316 --> 00:00:20,796
PART.1: This is the other one.

11
00:00:20,796 --> 00:00:21,116
PART.2: We should spread it
as much as possible
to see if we can...

12
00:00:21,196 --> 00:00:21,316
PART.1: This is the other one.

13
00:00:21,316 --> 00:00:22,996
PART.2: We should spread it
as much as possible
to see if we can...

14
00:00:22,996 --> 00:00:23,156
PART.1: Ok, so...

15
00:00:23,236 --> 00:00:23,796
PART.2: We should spread it
as much as possible
to see if we can...

16
00:00:23,796 --> 00:00:24,796
PART.1: Ok, so...

17
00:00:26,116 --> 00:00:26,716
PART.1: This thing.

18
00:00:26,716 --> 00:00:26,916
PART.2: Wow, there's a lot of things.

19
00:00:26,996 --> 00:00:27,116
PART.1: This thing.

20
00:00:27,116 --> 00:00:29,116
PART.2: Wow, there's a lot of things.

21
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,196
PART.1: I am not sure
this one is needed.

22
00:00:31,196 --> 00:00:31,236
PART.2: Do you think this is needed?

23
00:00:31,316 --> 00:00:31,396
PART.1: I am not sure
this one is needed.

24
00:00:31,396 --> 00:00:32,716
PART.2: Do you think this is needed?

25
00:00:32,716 --> 00:00:32,796
PART.1: No.

26
00:00:32,796 --> 00:00:33,516
PART.2: It doesn't look
that it is so I just put it there.

27
00:00:33,596 --> 00:00:33,716
PART.1: No.

28
00:00:33,716 --> 00:00:34,316
PART.2: It doesn't look
that it is so I just put it there.

29
00:00:34,316 --> 00:00:34,836
PART.1: I would go for the red ones.

30
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:35,716
PART.2: It doesn't look
that it is so I just put it there.

31
00:00:35,716 --> 00:00:36,196
PART.1: I would go for the red ones.

32
00:00:36,196 --> 00:00:36,436
PART.2: We need the wheels.

33
00:00:36,516 --> 00:00:36,796
PART.1: I would go for the red ones.

34
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:37,796
PART.2: We need the wheels.

35
00:00:38,196 --> 00:00:40,996
PART.1: I think this is maybe
the bottom of the car.

36
00:00:41,396 --> 00:00:41,796
PART.2: Yes...

37
00:00:41,796 --> 00:00:42,196
PART.1: No, because
it does not have this color.

38
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:42,396
PART.2: Yes...

39
00:00:42,396 --> 00:00:44,396
PART.1: No, because
it does not have this color.

40
00:00:45,116 --> 00:00:49,916
PART.2: Are you sure
it has to match the colors
that we see or...?

41
00:00:52,196 --> 00:00:54,596
PART.2: Because I'm suspecting
that this may be the base.

42
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:56,796
PART.1: Yes, but it doesn't
have a base.

43
00:00:56,996 --> 00:00:58,996
PART.2: Do you see this thing,
this brown?

44
00:00:59,116 --> 00:01:02,316
PART.1: Ah, you mean that,
ok, like this?
