PART.1: And then
there's a small one at the back,
the red one.

136
00:05:13,316 --> 00:05:14,916
PART.2: Is it the same?

137
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:20,516
PART.2: No, I think it is like
one piece and it's bend

138
00:05:20,796 --> 00:05:21,796
PART.1: Ah...

139
00:05:21,796 --> 00:05:22,796

140
00:05:23,516 --> 00:05:27,516
PART.1: But does it need this?

141
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:29,516

00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:45,396

149
00:05:47,316 --> 00:05:49,116
PART.1: But I don't know,
maybe not.

150
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,116

151
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:55,236
PART.1: No, actually it doesn't look bend,

152
00:05:55,316 --> 00:05:59,996
