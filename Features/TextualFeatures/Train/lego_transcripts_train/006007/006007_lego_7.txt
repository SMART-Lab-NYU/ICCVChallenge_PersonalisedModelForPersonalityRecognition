178
00:07:00,516 --> 00:07:01,516
PART.2: Yes.

179
00:07:01,996 --> 00:07:03,516

180
00:07:04,116 --> 00:07:07,916
PART.2: Could be,
is it similar no?

181
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:09,196
PART.2: Or no, we can look.

182
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:09,316
PART.1: No, it has another color.

183
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:09,516

00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:11,516
PART.1: No, it has another color.

185
00:07:12,316 --> 00:07:14,516
PART.1: I think
there's something missing.

186
00:07:14,996 --> 00:07:17,796
PART.1: Because we are at the front
and we can't see.

187
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:23,996
PART.2: At the front
there's a bit of confusion
because it is quiet open.

188
00:07:27,796 --> 00:07:29,196
PART.1: What do you mean?

189
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:37,916
PART.2: I mean, if I put it here
so the thing that is in the middle
should be...

190
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:37,956
PART.1: Can I see it?

191
00:07:38,036 --> 00:07:38,316
PART.2: I mean, if I put it here
so the thing that is in the middle
should be...

192
00:07:38,316 --> 00:07:40,316
PART.1: Can I see it?

193
00:07:46,316 --> 00:07:51,996
PART.1: I think it is fine
but maybe you are right
because where is this part?

194
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:55,796
PART.2: Oh, yes, this thing,
this is it.

195
00:07:55,796 --> 00:07:56,796
PART.1: Let's try to put this.

196
00:07:59,516 --> 00:08:02,716
PART.1: Yes, it looks like
this was like this.
