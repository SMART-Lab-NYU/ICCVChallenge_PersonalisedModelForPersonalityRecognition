322
00:14:02,796 --> 00:14:06,116

00:14:06,116 --> 00:14:06,596
PART.2: The green goes...
Ok, here.

324
00:14:06,676 --> 00:14:07,316
PART.1: And now the green one
and this red maybe.

325
00:14:07,316 --> 00:14:09,316

00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:14,396
PART.2: Yes.

328
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:21,396

PART.1: No.

335
00:14:41,796 --> 00:14:44,516

and we are not using the right base.

336
00:14:46,796 --> 00:14:50,916
PART.2: It's brown,
we should remove the base
and put something else.

337
00:14:53,596 --> 00:14:56,116
PART.1: Actually, maybe there is no...

338
00:14:57,116 --> 00:15:01,796
PART.2: There was no base
and this brown should be
something longer.
