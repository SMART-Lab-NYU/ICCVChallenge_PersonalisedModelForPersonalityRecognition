285
00:12:04,596 --> 00:12:10,796
PART.1: I think it is not the original plan
and there is no one smaller.

286
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:11,516
PART.1: We can improvise,
just use this.

287
00:12:11,516 --> 00:12:11,756
PART.2: Yes.

288
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:12,516
PART.1: We can improvise,
just use this.

289
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:13,396
PART.1: We can improvise,
just use this.

290
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:17,396

00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,196

292
00:12:28,396 --> 00:12:30,516

293
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:34,396

we can't fit anything in the middle.

00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:36,716
PART.2: Oh, yes...

295
00:12:39,316 --> 00:12:41,996

with one more here.

296
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,796
PART.1: Yes, just put whatever fits.

297
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:50,396
PART.1: And then we have like this color
and looks nice.

298
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:53,396
