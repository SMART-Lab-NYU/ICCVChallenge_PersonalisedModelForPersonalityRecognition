251
00:10:00,796 --> 00:10:04,516
PART.1: Because otherwise,
can you manage if it is like...?

252
00:10:04,596 --> 00:10:05,596
PART.2: Like this?

253
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:07,596
PART.1: Yes, because now
it is too high now again no?

254
00:10:09,196 --> 00:10:16,596
PART.1: This is not a line here
and there's a space
and now this higher than this one.

255
00:10:16,596 --> 00:10:17,596
PART.2: Yes.

256
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:20,716
PART.2: So, have you seen the brown?

257
00:10:21,196 --> 00:10:22,196
PART.1: This?

258
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:26,196
PART.1: No, that's not brown I think,
it is red or purple or whatever.

259
00:10:34,996 --> 00:10:36,396
PART.1: Yes, it is weird.

260
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:43,516
PART.2: And these are brown
behind the wheel
and on top there is a red?

261
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:46,196
PART.1: Yes, that I think looks fine
to be honest.

262
00:10:46,196 --> 00:10:48,516
PART.2: The thing is
this part is weird, yes.

263
00:10:49,796 --> 00:10:52,596
PART.1: Do you think
what happens if we put one here?

264
00:10:53,116 --> 00:10:54,116
PART.1: It is not aligned, right?

265
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:54,916
PART.2: No.

266
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:55,076
PART.1: What if we put another brown
in the body?

267
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:55,196
PART.2: No.

268
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,596
PART.1: What if we put another brown
in the body?

269
00:10:57,716 --> 00:10:58,396
PART.2: Yes, that would be good.

270
00:10:58,396 --> 00:10:58,716
PART.1: That doesn't look like this
but whatever...

271
00:10:58,796 --> 00:10:58,996
PART.2: Yes, that would be good.

272
00:10:58,996 --> 00:11:02,916
PART.1: That doesn't look like this
but whatever...
