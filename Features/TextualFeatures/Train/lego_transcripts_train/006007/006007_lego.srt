1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,996
PART.1: So, do you want first
to find the right pieces?

2
00:00:02,996 --> 00:00:03,036
PART.2: Yes!

3
00:00:03,116 --> 00:00:03,396
PART.1: So, do you want first
to find the right pieces?

4
00:00:03,396 --> 00:00:03,996
PART.2: Yes!

5
00:00:03,996 --> 00:00:07,596
PART.1: Ok, this looks
like a piece for the car.

6
00:00:07,596 --> 00:00:08,596
PART.2: Yes, this thing.

7
00:00:08,796 --> 00:00:11,796
PART.1: Then we need to find
another one for the same kind.

8
00:00:12,516 --> 00:00:13,796
PART.2: Yes.

9
00:00:14,316 --> 00:00:19,796
PART.1: Ups, let's try and put
all the things all over the table.

10
00:00:20,316 --> 00:00:20,796
PART.1: This is the other one.

11
00:00:20,796 --> 00:00:21,116
PART.2: We should spread it
as much as possible
to see if we can...

12
00:00:21,196 --> 00:00:21,316
PART.1: This is the other one.

13
00:00:21,316 --> 00:00:22,996
PART.2: We should spread it
as much as possible
to see if we can...

14
00:00:22,996 --> 00:00:23,156
PART.1: Ok, so...

15
00:00:23,236 --> 00:00:23,796
PART.2: We should spread it
as much as possible
to see if we can...

16
00:00:23,796 --> 00:00:24,796
PART.1: Ok, so...

17
00:00:26,116 --> 00:00:26,716
PART.1: This thing.

18
00:00:26,716 --> 00:00:26,916
PART.2: Wow, there's a lot of things.

19
00:00:26,996 --> 00:00:27,116
PART.1: This thing.

20
00:00:27,116 --> 00:00:29,116
PART.2: Wow, there's a lot of things.

21
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,196
PART.1: I am not sure
this one is needed.

22
00:00:31,196 --> 00:00:31,236
PART.2: Do you think this is needed?

23
00:00:31,316 --> 00:00:31,396
PART.1: I am not sure
this one is needed.

24
00:00:31,396 --> 00:00:32,716
PART.2: Do you think this is needed?

25
00:00:32,716 --> 00:00:32,796
PART.1: No.

26
00:00:32,796 --> 00:00:33,516
PART.2: It doesn't look
that it is so I just put it there.

27
00:00:33,596 --> 00:00:33,716
PART.1: No.

28
00:00:33,716 --> 00:00:34,316
PART.2: It doesn't look
that it is so I just put it there.

29
00:00:34,316 --> 00:00:34,836
PART.1: I would go for the red ones.

30
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:35,716
PART.2: It doesn't look
that it is so I just put it there.

31
00:00:35,716 --> 00:00:36,196
PART.1: I would go for the red ones.

32
00:00:36,196 --> 00:00:36,436
PART.2: We need the wheels.

33
00:00:36,516 --> 00:00:36,796
PART.1: I would go for the red ones.

34
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:37,796
PART.2: We need the wheels.

35
00:00:38,196 --> 00:00:40,996
PART.1: I think this is maybe
the bottom of the car.

36
00:00:41,396 --> 00:00:41,796
PART.2: Yes...

37
00:00:41,796 --> 00:00:42,196
PART.1: No, because
it does not have this color.

38
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:42,396
PART.2: Yes...

39
00:00:42,396 --> 00:00:44,396
PART.1: No, because
it does not have this color.

40
00:00:45,116 --> 00:00:49,916
PART.2: Are you sure
it has to match the colors
that we see or...?

41
00:00:52,196 --> 00:00:54,596
PART.2: Because I'm suspecting
that this may be the base.

42
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:56,796
PART.1: Yes, but it doesn't
have a base.

43
00:00:56,996 --> 00:00:58,996
PART.2: Do you see this thing,
this brown?

44
00:00:59,116 --> 00:01:02,316
PART.1: Ah, you mean that,
ok, like this?

45
00:01:05,796 --> 00:01:06,796
PART.2: I don't know.

46
00:01:08,116 --> 00:01:10,916
PART.1: Ok, let's try to continue.

47
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,036
PART.2: To put things together,
so you see like there's...

48
00:01:12,116 --> 00:01:12,796
PART.1: Ok, let's try to continue.

49
00:01:12,796 --> 00:01:13,796
PART.2: To put things together,
so you see like there's...

50
00:01:13,996 --> 00:01:15,196
PART.2: Ah, ok, I see.

51
00:01:15,316 --> 00:01:16,996
PART.1: Ok, these are for the wheels.

52
00:01:16,996 --> 00:01:17,116
PART.2: I think I get it
so this goes between?

53
00:01:17,196 --> 00:01:17,316
PART.1: Ok, these are for the wheels.

54
00:01:17,316 --> 00:01:18,996
PART.2: I think I get it
so this goes between?

55
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:19,156
PART.1: Is that for wheels, no?

56
00:01:19,236 --> 00:01:19,516
PART.2: I think I get it
so this goes between?

57
00:01:19,516 --> 00:01:20,396
PART.1: Is that for wheels, no?

58
00:01:20,596 --> 00:01:22,396
PART.2: Yes, it is something like this.

59
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:28,396
PART.1: Ok, you're right I think.

60
00:01:28,396 --> 00:01:30,796
PART.2: And then, this should be...

61
00:01:30,796 --> 00:01:30,876
PART.1: This, I think, looks like...

62
00:01:30,956 --> 00:01:30,996
PART.2: And then, this should be...

63
00:01:30,996 --> 00:01:33,916
PART.1: This, I think, looks like...

64
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:39,116
PART.2: One in the beginning
and one should be similar...

65
00:01:39,116 --> 00:01:45,516
PART.2: Ah, no! You see?
There's only one
so it has to be something like this.

66
00:01:46,596 --> 00:01:47,796
PART.2: You see there's only one?

67
00:01:47,796 --> 00:01:48,796
PART.1: Hmmm.

68
00:01:49,796 --> 00:01:53,796
PART.1: Ok, this is
part of the nose for sure.

69
00:01:54,316 --> 00:01:57,116
PART.2: Yes and it should go
from the top

70
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,396
PART.2: From top of this, yes.

71
00:02:03,596 --> 00:02:05,396
PART.2: It should be
one more like this.

72
00:02:05,796 --> 00:02:06,796
PART.1: Yes?

73
00:02:07,116 --> 00:02:07,316
PART.2: There are two, cool.

74
00:02:07,316 --> 00:02:07,676
PART.1: Here, here.

75
00:02:07,756 --> 00:02:08,316
PART.2: There are two, cool.

76
00:02:08,316 --> 00:02:09,316
PART.2: There are two, cool.

77
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:14,316
PART.1: Ok, so that's the nose, no?

78
00:02:14,316 --> 00:02:16,916
PART.2: Yes and there's something
that goes between the nose.

79
00:02:16,996 --> 00:02:21,916
PART.1: Yes, I think
that is the wheel,
that black part.

80
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:25,996
PART.2: Oh, yes, that's true,
so it will go between.

81
00:02:27,196 --> 00:02:28,396
PART.2: It should go like this.

82
00:02:28,596 --> 00:02:29,596
PART.1: Yes.

83
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:30,916
PART.2: Cool.

84
00:02:34,116 --> 00:02:35,116
PART.2: Ok.

85
00:02:36,396 --> 00:02:42,996
PART.2: And there should be
something after this wheel.

86
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,996
PART.1: What do you mean after?

87
00:02:44,996 --> 00:02:45,396
PART.2: After the black part.

88
00:02:45,396 --> 00:02:45,716
PART.1: Ah, yes.

89
00:02:45,796 --> 00:02:46,396
PART.2: After the black part.

90
00:02:46,396 --> 00:02:46,996
PART.2: After the black part.

91
00:02:47,596 --> 00:02:49,396
PART.2: But let's see.

92
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:53,516
PART.2: And the other one
will go behind I suppose?

93
00:02:54,116 --> 00:02:59,116
PART.1: Maybe like this
because this looks like a wheel
like this maybe?

94
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:03,116
PART.1: Because it has like hole
for a wheel, no?

95
00:03:03,796 --> 00:03:05,716
PART.2: Yes, oh, yes.

96
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,996
PART.1: But I am not sure,
I am just guessing.

97
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,996
PART.2: Looks like it.

98
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:11,996
PART.2: Let's take this off.

99
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,796
PART.2: The hole fits...?

100
00:03:20,396 --> 00:03:21,796
PART.1: There's another one.

101
00:03:22,796 --> 00:03:26,596
PART.1: I am not sure,
maybe it is wrong,
maybe it is not part of this.

102
00:03:27,316 --> 00:03:28,916
PART.1: Let me see,
can I see it?

103
00:03:31,516 --> 00:03:32,996
PART.1: Maybe no...

104
00:03:34,996 --> 00:03:35,996
PART.1: No...

105
00:03:36,996 --> 00:03:38,796
PART.2: It does not look like
there is something going
on the top of the wheel.

106
00:03:38,796 --> 00:03:39,196
PART.1: Maybe there's nothing there,
maybe there's nothing there.

107
00:03:39,276 --> 00:03:39,796
PART.2: It does not look like
there is something going
on the top of the wheel.

108
00:03:39,796 --> 00:03:41,796
PART.1: Maybe there's nothing there,
maybe there's nothing there.

109
00:03:41,796 --> 00:03:42,796
PART.2: Yes.

110
00:03:43,116 --> 00:03:51,796
PART.1: I think there's a hole here
so I think there's something like this
but like this,
you know what I mean?

111
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:52,796
PART.2: Yes.

112
00:03:52,796 --> 00:03:53,796
PART.1: It's on the side.

113
00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:54,796
PART.1: Maybe it's...
It's on the side.

114
00:03:54,796 --> 00:03:55,796
PART.1: Like this...

115
00:04:01,396 --> 00:04:02,796
PART.1: But then
he wheels don't fit.

116
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,116
PART.2: No, I think is more like this.

117
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,996
PART.1: Ah, yes,
maybe you are right.

118
00:04:10,196 --> 00:04:11,996
PART.2: And the wheel is here.

119
00:04:13,196 --> 00:04:14,196
PART.2: We need something that...

120
00:04:14,196 --> 00:04:14,276
PART.1: Yes, this, yes.

121
00:04:14,356 --> 00:04:14,516
PART.2: We need something that...

122
00:04:14,516 --> 00:04:16,516
PART.1: Yes, this, yes.

123
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:21,716
PART.2: Like this.

124
00:04:24,116 --> 00:04:26,116
PART.1: This thing is so heavy, no?

125
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,716
PART.1: This is so heavy on my neck.

126
00:04:32,116 --> 00:04:37,796
PART.1: Ok, there are the other
and there must be more of this.

127
00:04:38,996 --> 00:04:40,596
PART.2: For more wheels.

128
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:43,796
PART.1: Oh, there's one more
for one more wheel.

129
00:04:44,796 --> 00:04:47,796
PART.2: I will manage to put the wheels
and you can look for the rest.

130
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:50,396
PART.1: Ok, that's the fourth
that is next to you.

131
00:04:52,116 --> 00:04:53,316
PART.1: Ok, so...

132
00:04:57,796 --> 00:05:01,916
PART.1: I still don't understand
but it is probably this piece
in the middle, no?

133
00:05:02,196 --> 00:05:03,116
PART.2: Yes, it does.

134
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:03,396
PART.2: Yes, it does.

135
00:05:06,196 --> 00:05:10,796
PART.1: And then
there's a small one at the back,
the red one.

136
00:05:13,316 --> 00:05:14,916
PART.2: Is it the same?

137
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:20,516
PART.2: No, I think it is like
one piece and it's bend
so it should be like and edge on the...

138
00:05:20,796 --> 00:05:21,796
PART.1: Ah...

139
00:05:21,796 --> 00:05:22,796
PART.2: It looks like it.

140
00:05:23,516 --> 00:05:27,516
PART.1: But does it need this?

141
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:29,516
PART.1: At the end of it?

142
00:05:31,516 --> 00:05:31,796
PART.1: I think there is one.

143
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:32,156
PART.2: Yes or maybe could be.

144
00:05:32,236 --> 00:05:32,596
PART.1: I think there is one.

145
00:05:32,596 --> 00:05:33,596
PART.2: Yes or maybe could be.

146
00:05:35,316 --> 00:05:37,796
PART.1: There must be another one,
no, this look.

147
00:05:38,316 --> 00:05:42,396
PART.2: I am missing one piece
of the wheel and I think is this.

148
00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:45,396
PART.1: I think is this one at the end.

149
00:05:47,316 --> 00:05:49,116
PART.1: But I don't know,
maybe not.

150
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,116
PART.2: Let's try.

151
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:55,236
PART.1: No, actually it doesn't look bend,
I think you say

152
00:05:55,316 --> 00:05:59,996
PART.1: because it has and it is like this
and then this is flag.

153
00:06:00,596 --> 00:06:01,796
PART.2: So, you mean this red?

154
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:02,756
PART.2: I think it comes in the end
and this is this.

155
00:06:02,836 --> 00:06:03,196
PART.2: So, you mean this red?

156
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,196
PART.2: I think it comes in the end
and this is this.

157
00:06:05,516 --> 00:06:08,316
PART.1: This is this
and this has an edge on the top.

158
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:11,916
PART.1: Can I see it?

159
00:06:13,396 --> 00:06:16,996
PART.1: Yes and I think no,
you are right.

160
00:06:17,116 --> 00:06:18,996
PART.1: Something is not ok.

161
00:06:21,596 --> 00:06:23,396
PART.1: No, it's...

162
00:06:25,516 --> 00:06:26,516
PART.1: Why?

163
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,796
PART.2: It looks something like this.

164
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:31,796
PART.1: Maybe this?

165
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:37,116
PART.1: No, it is too short
or is it like this?

166
00:06:37,116 --> 00:06:39,116
PART.1: Look and then this?

167
00:06:39,796 --> 00:06:40,796
PART.2: Yes.

168
00:06:40,796 --> 00:06:41,796
PART.1: Yes.

169
00:06:41,796 --> 00:06:42,796
PART.2: It is.

170
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:45,916
PART.1: Ok, like this
and then there's an edge
on the top.

171
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,916
PART.2: Top, which is this.

172
00:06:49,196 --> 00:06:51,596
PART.2: But it looks like a smaller piece,
something like this.

173
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:51,756
PART.1: Yes.

174
00:06:51,836 --> 00:06:52,596
PART.2: But it looks like a smaller piece,
something like this.

175
00:06:52,596 --> 00:06:54,596
PART.2: But it looks like a smaller piece,
something like this.

176
00:06:54,596 --> 00:06:56,796
PART.1: I think that one plus the...

177
00:06:58,796 --> 00:07:00,396
PART.1: We need another one of this.

178
00:07:00,516 --> 00:07:01,516
PART.2: Yes.

179
00:07:01,996 --> 00:07:03,516
PART.1: I think something is missing.

180
00:07:04,116 --> 00:07:07,916
PART.2: Could be,
is it similar no?

181
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:09,196
PART.2: Or no, we can look.

182
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:09,316
PART.1: No, it has another color.

183
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:09,516
PART.2: Or no, we can look.

184
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:11,516
PART.1: No, it has another color.

185
00:07:12,316 --> 00:07:14,516
PART.1: I think
there's something missing.

186
00:07:14,996 --> 00:07:17,796
PART.1: Because we are at the front
and we can't see.

187
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:23,996
PART.2: At the front
there's a bit of confusion
because it is quiet open.

188
00:07:27,796 --> 00:07:29,196
PART.1: What do you mean?

189
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:37,916
PART.2: I mean, if I put it here
so the thing that is in the middle
should be...

190
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:37,956
PART.1: Can I see it?

191
00:07:38,036 --> 00:07:38,316
PART.2: I mean, if I put it here
so the thing that is in the middle
should be...

192
00:07:38,316 --> 00:07:40,316
PART.1: Can I see it?

193
00:07:46,316 --> 00:07:51,996
PART.1: I think it is fine
but maybe you are right
because where is this part?

194
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:55,796
PART.2: Oh, yes, this thing,
this is it.

195
00:07:55,796 --> 00:07:56,796
PART.1: Let's try to put this.

196
00:07:59,516 --> 00:08:02,716
PART.1: Yes, it looks like
this was like this.

197
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:03,676
PART.1: Or something is missing.

198
00:08:03,756 --> 00:08:04,996
PART.2: Overlaping on the brown
and the red.

199
00:08:05,396 --> 00:08:09,796
PART.1: This part is not the one
that we are using here.

200
00:08:14,596 --> 00:08:16,996
PART.1: D we have anything
that looks like...?

201
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:21,316
PART.1: No.

202
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:24,396
PART.1: Yes, because it will look like this
but it is not on the right...

203
00:08:24,396 --> 00:08:25,796
PART.2: Yes, do you see this is red?

204
00:08:25,876 --> 00:08:28,596
PART.1: Yes, because it will look like this
but it is not on the right...

205
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:29,396
PART.2: Yes, do you see this is red?

206
00:08:29,516 --> 00:08:31,396
PART.2: This is like, one second...

207
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:39,316
PART.2: Should I go?

208
00:08:39,316 --> 00:08:39,436
PART.1: Oh, oh, it is bad.

209
00:08:39,516 --> 00:08:39,596
PART.2: Should I go?

210
00:08:39,596 --> 00:08:41,596
PART.1: Oh, oh, it is bad.

211
00:08:41,596 --> 00:08:43,596
PART.2: This piece...

212
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:49,196
PART.1: I think...

213
00:08:50,116 --> 00:08:53,196
PART.2: This red should be
the brown one.

214
00:08:53,396 --> 00:08:58,396
PART.1: Yes, there's a brown
and I think we forgot
to put the brown piece in here.

215
00:08:58,476 --> 00:08:58,516
PART.1: Yes, there's a brown
and I think we forgot
to put the brown piece in here.

216
00:08:58,516 --> 00:08:59,516
PART.2: Here, yes.

217
00:08:59,996 --> 00:09:00,996
PART.1: Yes.

218
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:07,996
PART.2: Brown is in the very back
so I should remove this one
and now there's a small...

219
00:09:07,996 --> 00:09:08,116
PART.1: I think something
like this or this.

220
00:09:08,196 --> 00:09:08,516
PART.2: Brown is in the very back
so I should remove this one
and now there's a small...

221
00:09:08,516 --> 00:09:10,516
PART.1: I think something
like this or this.

222
00:09:11,196 --> 00:09:11,796
PART.1: No, it is smaller.

223
00:09:11,796 --> 00:09:12,156
PART.2: No, it is smaller,
it should be something like this.

224
00:09:12,236 --> 00:09:12,396
PART.1: No, it is smaller.

225
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:14,996
PART.2: No, it is smaller,
it should be something like this.

226
00:09:14,996 --> 00:09:15,996
PART.1: No, this, this!

227
00:09:16,396 --> 00:09:17,996
PART.2: Yes, it is this, it is the same.

228
00:09:17,996 --> 00:09:18,996
PART.1: Ah, ok.

229
00:09:20,396 --> 00:09:22,916
PART.2: The brown goes here
and now the...

230
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:23,916
PART.1: Now the red.

231
00:09:25,596 --> 00:09:27,396
PART.2: The red goes on top
of the brown and the black.

232
00:09:27,396 --> 00:09:27,836
PART.1: Yes, and the black.

233
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:28,796
PART.2: The red goes on top
of the brown and the black.

234
00:09:28,796 --> 00:09:28,996
PART.1: Yes, and the black.

235
00:09:30,996 --> 00:09:31,996
PART.2: Ok.

236
00:09:32,996 --> 00:09:35,116
PART.2: Now it makes sense.

237
00:09:35,716 --> 00:09:38,116
PART.1: Maybe there's another brown
here in the middle.

238
00:09:38,116 --> 00:09:39,116
PART.2: Yes, there is.

239
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:41,996
PART.1: And we put
a browner in the middle.

240
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:43,796
PART.2: Like here, like this?

241
00:09:43,796 --> 00:09:45,116
PART.1: Yes, to make it even.

242
00:09:45,116 --> 00:09:45,516
PART.2: Even, yes.

243
00:09:45,516 --> 00:09:45,836
PART.1: No, no, I mean here.

244
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:46,116
PART.2: Even, yes.

245
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:47,116
PART.1: No, no, I mean here.

246
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:49,916
PART.2: But...

247
00:09:50,316 --> 00:09:51,316
PART.1: No?

248
00:09:51,316 --> 00:09:53,796
PART.2: Do you see the brown
slightly behind the wheel?

249
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:57,996
PART.1: Yes, but do you think
there's no brown here?

250
00:09:58,796 --> 00:10:00,796
PART.2: There is
and there could be a white.

251
00:10:00,796 --> 00:10:04,516
PART.1: Because otherwise,
can you manage if it is like...?

252
00:10:04,596 --> 00:10:05,596
PART.2: Like this?

253
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:07,596
PART.1: Yes, because now
it is too high now again no?

254
00:10:09,196 --> 00:10:16,596
PART.1: This is not a line here
and there's a space
and now this higher than this one.

255
00:10:16,596 --> 00:10:17,596
PART.2: Yes.

256
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:20,716
PART.2: So, have you seen the brown?

257
00:10:21,196 --> 00:10:22,196
PART.1: This?

258
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:26,196
PART.1: No, that's not brown I think,
it is red or purple or whatever.

259
00:10:34,996 --> 00:10:36,396
PART.1: Yes, it is weird.

260
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:43,516
PART.2: And these are brown
behind the wheel
and on top there is a red?

261
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:46,196
PART.1: Yes, that I think looks fine
to be honest.

262
00:10:46,196 --> 00:10:48,516
PART.2: The thing is
this part is weird, yes.

263
00:10:49,796 --> 00:10:52,596
PART.1: Do you think
what happens if we put one here?

264
00:10:53,116 --> 00:10:54,116
PART.1: It is not aligned, right?

265
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:54,916
PART.2: No.

266
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:55,076
PART.1: What if we put another brown
in the body?

267
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:55,196
PART.2: No.

268
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,596
PART.1: What if we put another brown
in the body?

269
00:10:57,716 --> 00:10:58,396
PART.2: Yes, that would be good.

270
00:10:58,396 --> 00:10:58,716
PART.1: That doesn't look like this
but whatever...

271
00:10:58,796 --> 00:10:58,996
PART.2: Yes, that would be good.

272
00:10:58,996 --> 00:11:02,916
PART.1: That doesn't look like this
but whatever...

273
00:11:04,796 --> 00:11:05,796
PART.2: Also there is...

274
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:09,516
PART.2: I would like to see
where the red will go.

275
00:11:11,116 --> 00:11:12,996
PART.1: Yes, I don't know.

276
00:11:13,516 --> 00:11:14,996
PART.1: There's one there.

277
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:24,596
PART.2: Yes, it should be aligned
like this so it means
there is a brown one
like the little one to make it.

278
00:11:25,516 --> 00:11:26,596
PART.1: But this is...

279
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,916
PART.2: Yes, I see what happens.

280
00:11:30,716 --> 00:11:31,916
PART.2: What we need is...

281
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:35,396
PART.1: I would put one smaller,
yes, this.

282
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,396
PART.2: This one maybe?

283
00:11:39,996 --> 00:11:41,996
PART.2: And then there should be
one more smaller like this.

284
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:55,196
PART.1: This is not really...
Here, no!

285
00:12:04,596 --> 00:12:10,796
PART.1: I think it is not the original plan
and there is no one smaller.

286
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:11,516
PART.1: We can improvise,
just use this.

287
00:12:11,516 --> 00:12:11,756
PART.2: Yes.

288
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:12,516
PART.1: We can improvise,
just use this.

289
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:13,396
PART.1: We can improvise,
just use this.

290
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:17,396
PART.2: Ok, now this can fit.

291
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,196
PART.2: Like this.

292
00:12:28,396 --> 00:12:30,516
PART.2: And then the other one is here.

293
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:34,396
PART.1: I am still concerned
we can't fit anything in the middle.

294
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:36,716
PART.2: Oh, yes...

295
00:12:39,316 --> 00:12:41,996
PART.1: This should be
with one more here.

296
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,796
PART.1: Yes, just put whatever fits.

297
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:50,396
PART.1: And then we have like this color
and looks nice.

298
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:53,396
PART.1: Like this color, let's use this.

299
00:12:58,396 --> 00:12:59,396
PART.1: Yes.

300
00:13:01,116 --> 00:13:03,516
PART.1: It always looks wrong!

301
00:13:05,516 --> 00:13:07,996
PART.1: Let's try one,
it doesn't look good.

302
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:08,436
PART.2: If I remove one layer
then it will be even.

303
00:13:08,516 --> 00:13:08,916
PART.1: Let's try one,
it doesn't look good.

304
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:12,516
PART.2: If I remove one layer
then it will be even.

305
00:13:12,516 --> 00:13:16,116
PART.1: Right, ok,
we miss something like this.

306
00:13:20,796 --> 00:13:21,996
PART.2: This is really hard.

307
00:13:22,196 --> 00:13:25,516
PART.1: I know, do you want me
to help as I have smaller fingers?

308
00:13:26,396 --> 00:13:28,796
PART.2: Right, then it would be
other brown one.

309
00:13:37,396 --> 00:13:40,196
PART.2: So, now what we want is...

310
00:13:40,316 --> 00:13:42,196
PART.1: Put this purple.

311
00:13:43,196 --> 00:13:44,996
PART.2: Yes, maybe put only one?

312
00:13:46,396 --> 00:13:48,596
PART.1: Yes, to make it even.

313
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:50,116
PART.2: And then we put...

314
00:13:50,116 --> 00:13:51,796
PART.1: The purple break.

315
00:13:51,796 --> 00:13:51,876
PART.2: Yes.

316
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:52,116
PART.1: The purple break.

317
00:13:52,116 --> 00:13:52,796
PART.2: Yes.

318
00:13:55,996 --> 00:13:57,996
PART.2: There's it is, yes.

319
00:14:00,116 --> 00:14:02,516
PART.2: Nice, looks more real.

320
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:02,636
PART.1: And now the green one
and this red maybe.

321
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:02,796
PART.2: Nice, looks more real.

322
00:14:02,796 --> 00:14:06,116
PART.1: And now the green one
and this red maybe.

323
00:14:06,116 --> 00:14:06,596
PART.2: The green goes...
Ok, here.

324
00:14:06,676 --> 00:14:07,316
PART.1: And now the green one
and this red maybe.

325
00:14:07,316 --> 00:14:09,316
PART.2: The green goes...
Ok, here.

326
00:14:12,396 --> 00:14:13,396
PART.1: Is this?

327
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:14,396
PART.2: Yes.

328
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:21,396
PART.1: And then I think this one
goes at the back,
this long one.

329
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:23,916
PART.2: Yes.

330
00:14:27,796 --> 00:14:30,196
PART.1: Where are the small edges?

331
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:37,796
PART.2: And something we...
I don't think this thing
goes below the wheels.

332
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:41,316
PART.1: No.

333
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:41,676
PART.2: This thing is the base
and we are not using the right base.

334
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:41,796
PART.1: No.

335
00:14:41,796 --> 00:14:44,516
PART.2: This thing is the base
and we are not using the right base.

336
00:14:46,796 --> 00:14:50,916
PART.2: It's brown,
we should remove the base
and put something else.

337
00:14:53,596 --> 00:14:56,116
PART.1: Actually, maybe there is no...

338
00:14:57,116 --> 00:15:01,796
PART.2: There was no base
and this brown should be
something longer.

339
00:15:02,196 --> 00:15:07,316
PART.1: Although, I can like it,
do we need to exactly this
or share something together?

340
00:15:07,316 --> 00:15:07,476
PART.2: Ok, so the only thing missing
is that we remove the black
and the brown thing
and we put this one.

341
00:15:07,556 --> 00:15:07,716
PART.1: Although, I can like it,
do we need to exactly this
or share something together?

342
00:15:07,716 --> 00:15:15,996
PART.2: Ok, so the only thing missing
is that we remove the black
and the brown thing
and we put this one.

343
00:15:15,996 --> 00:15:17,796
PART.2: And then it is exactly
what they want.

344
00:15:18,396 --> 00:15:19,796
PART.1: Ok, do you think?

345
00:15:19,796 --> 00:15:21,516
PART.2: Yes, I think it is done.

346
00:15:21,516 --> 00:15:21,676
PART.1: There is no base
and we have to restore
the whole thing.

347
00:15:21,756 --> 00:15:21,796
PART.2: Yes, I think it is done.

348
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,396
PART.1: There is no base
and we have to restore
the whole thing.

349
00:15:24,596 --> 00:15:26,396
PART.2: No, just this here.

350
00:15:26,996 --> 00:15:27,796
PART.1: Are you sure?

351
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:27,876
PART.2: Yes, you will see.

352
00:15:27,956 --> 00:15:27,996
PART.1: Are you sure?

353
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:29,796
PART.2: Yes, you will see.

354
00:15:30,516 --> 00:15:31,796
PART.1: Ah, I know what you mean.

355
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,796
PART.1: Yes, you have to remove
that is smaller.

356
00:15:37,796 --> 00:15:38,796
PART.2: This?

357
00:15:38,796 --> 00:15:38,996
PART.1: Yes.

358
00:15:38,996 --> 00:15:39,516
PART.2: We put this in the middle?

359
00:15:39,596 --> 00:15:39,796
PART.1: Yes.

360
00:15:39,796 --> 00:15:41,796
PART.2: We put this in the middle?

361
00:15:42,116 --> 00:15:42,316
PART.1: Yes.

362
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:42,676
PART.2: Ups.

363
00:15:42,756 --> 00:15:43,116
PART.1: Yes.

364
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:43,316
PART.2: Ups.

365
00:15:46,396 --> 00:15:48,716
PART.2: I think this one is breaking.

366
00:15:50,596 --> 00:15:53,996
PART.2: It is like this
and then we put the pieces normally.

367
00:16:01,796 --> 00:16:02,796
PART.2: Is it like this?

368
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:06,796
PART.1: Can I see it?

369
00:16:08,116 --> 00:16:10,596
PART.1: I think so, yes,
I think so.

370
00:16:10,996 --> 00:16:11,916
PART.2: We need this?

371
00:16:11,996 --> 00:16:12,996
PART.1: Yes, you can...

372
00:16:12,996 --> 00:16:13,516
PART.2: No!

373
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:13,756
PART.1: No? Why?

374
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:13,996
PART.2: No!

375
00:16:13,996 --> 00:16:14,596
PART.1: No? Why?

376
00:16:14,596 --> 00:16:15,796
PART.2: Why do I need this?

377
00:16:15,796 --> 00:16:17,796
PART.1: Yes, that's the nose.

378
00:16:17,796 --> 00:16:20,196
PART.2: Yes, the nose goes here.

379
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:26,916
PART.2: This no?

380
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,716
PART.2: And then
the brown one goes here?

381
00:16:29,716 --> 00:16:31,916
PART.1: But not brown, this one,
the purple.

382
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:32,916
PART.2: The purple?

383
00:16:33,596 --> 00:16:36,396
PART.1: I think so,
if not color brown but...

384
00:16:36,516 --> 00:16:39,396
PART.2: Ok, and then this thing?

385
00:16:42,396 --> 00:16:43,996
PART.2: I think we have
the machine ready.

386
00:16:44,196 --> 00:16:45,196
PART.1: Nice.

387
00:16:45,396 --> 00:16:46,916
PART.2: This one goes up.

388
00:16:46,996 --> 00:16:50,116
PART.1: Yes, but at front.

389
00:16:50,116 --> 00:16:51,596
PART.2: Yes, like this?

390
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,996
PART.1: Ok and then this?

391
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:55,516
PART.2: This one which is...

392
00:16:55,796 --> 00:16:57,516
PART.1: But still
we don't have this for the...

393
00:16:58,716 --> 00:17:01,796
PART.2: The two edges, right?
This thing.

394
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,116
PART.1: But there's another one or not?

395
00:17:04,196 --> 00:17:05,796
PART.2: Yes, there should be one more.

396
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,596
PART.1: I think that is here.

397
00:17:09,116 --> 00:17:10,596
PART.1: Yes, cool.

398
00:17:13,796 --> 00:17:15,796
PART.1: Nice! Yes!

399
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:27,196
PART.1: That's right because I have
no special vision
of what is this piece here.

400
00:17:27,716 --> 00:17:32,116
PART.2: We did it perfectly,
I mean is exactly
what they show in this figure.

401
00:17:32,116 --> 00:17:39,396
PART.1: Yes, I wonder how old
is this for kids or three-year-old
kids or something.

402
00:17:39,396 --> 00:17:39,476
PART.2: If they follow the guide...

403
00:17:39,556 --> 00:17:39,716
PART.1: Yes, I wonder how old
is this for kids or three-year-old
kids or something.

404
00:17:39,716 --> 00:17:41,716
PART.2: If they follow the guide...

405
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:43,716
PART.2: Now we can check.

406
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,316
PART.1: Ah, we didn't follow the guide.

407
00:17:49,316 --> 00:17:50,316
PART.2: No, we don't.

408
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:52,996
PART.1: I don't even realize
that was a guide.

409
00:17:55,716 --> 00:17:56,716
PART.1: Ok.

410
00:17:58,116 --> 00:18:00,796
PART.2: I am happy we managed
without a guide.

411
00:18:01,396 --> 00:18:02,396
PART.1: Yes.

412
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:05,316
PART.1: Cool.

413
00:18:07,316 --> 00:18:08,796
PART.2: We should have
extra points for this.

414
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:08,876
PART.1: Yes.

415
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:09,316
PART.2: We should have
extra points for this.

416
00:18:09,316 --> 00:18:09,796
PART.1: Yes.

417
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,116
PART.1: Are we still being watched?

418
00:18:14,316 --> 00:18:16,116
PART.2: Yes, like six cameras.

419
00:18:18,196 --> 00:18:20,796
PART.1: Do we have to build
other things right now?

420
00:18:21,396 --> 00:18:22,796
PART.2: It can be...

421
00:18:25,796 --> 00:18:30,796
PART.1: We can be at the lake
and the garden.
