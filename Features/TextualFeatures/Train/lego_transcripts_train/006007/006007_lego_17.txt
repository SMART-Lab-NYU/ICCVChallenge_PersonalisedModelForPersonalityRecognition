394
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,116
PART.1: But there's another one or not?

395
00:17:04,196 --> 00:17:05,796
PART.2: Yes, there should be one more.

396
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,596
PART.1: I think that is here.

397
00:17:09,116 --> 00:17:10,596
PART.1: Yes, cool.

398
00:17:13,796 --> 00:17:15,796
PART.1: Nice! Yes!

399
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:27,196
PART.1: That's right because I have
no special vision
of what is this piece here.

400
00:17:27,716 --> 00:17:32,116
PART.2: We did it perfectly,
I mean is exactly
what they show in this figure.

401
00:17:32,116 --> 00:17:39,396
PART.1: Yes, I wonder how old
is this for kids or three-year-old
kids or something.

402
00:17:39,396 --> 00:17:39,476
PART.2: If they follow the guide...

403
00:17:39,556 --> 00:17:39,716
PART.1: Yes, I wonder how old
is this for kids or three-year-old
kids or something.

404
00:17:39,716 --> 00:17:41,716
PART.2: If they follow the guide...

405
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:43,716
PART.2: Now we can check.

406
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,316
PART.1: Ah, we didn't follow the guide.

407
00:17:49,316 --> 00:17:50,316
PART.2: No, we don't.

408
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:52,996
PART.1: I don't even realize
that was a guide.

409
00:17:55,716 --> 00:17:56,716
PART.1: Ok.

410
00:17:58,116 --> 00:18:00,796
PART.2: I am happy we managed
without a guide.
