00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:24,345

00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:49,985
PART.2: Oh it's this.

51
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:55,385
PART.1: And two small black triangles.

52
00:01:55,967 --> 00:02:00,385
PART.1: Or maybe gray again because I can't really divide gray and like...

53
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:03,985
PART.2: They look weird.

54
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:11,865

00:02:14,745 --> 00:02:15,745
PART.1: Yeah, perfect.

00:02:15,865 --> 00:02:18,585

PART.1: And we need blue and a white. And a big blue.

61
00:02:25,665 --> 00:02:27,305

62
00:02:27,385 --> 00:02:29,105
PART.1: Oh, we're getting there.

00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:43,865
PART.1: Okay.

69
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:47,785
PART.1: This one maybe? No, it's a bit different.

70
00:02:48,345 --> 00:02:53,985
PART.1: It's gray and it's like this. And that should be too. Really?

71
00:02:54,505 --> 00:02:55,945
PART.2: This one.

72
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:58,425
PART.1: Okay, we need some...

73
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:01,705
PART.2: Do we put is here on the gray or? Where?

74
00:03:01,985 --> 00:03:04,065
PART.1: It's in the blue one you have to turn it around.

75
00:03:04,145 --> 00:03:05,570
PART.2: OK we're on the other way.

76
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:07,665
PART.1: And it has to...

77
00:03:09,945 --> 00:03:11,025
PART.1: What? Is there...

PART.2: Three wheels.

82
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:26,905
PART.1: This one.

83
00:03:27,105 --> 00:03:27,585
PART.2: Oh okay.

84
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,193
PART.1: And this three times, two and three.

85
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:30,585
PART.1: Okay.

86
00:03:30,665 --> 00:03:31,745
PART.2: Perfect.

87
00:03:37,145 --> 00:03:38,145
PART.1: Ah I want to build too.

88
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:40,345
PART.2: Take a wheel.

89
00:03:40,425 --> 00:03:42,905
PART.1: Yay. Actually it's quite fun.

90
00:03:42,985 --> 00:03:47,105
PART.2: Don't break it. We need to fly home with this.

91
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,785
PART.1: Sure. With this one I would not go inside.

92
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:52,345
PART.1: Oh no wait we've done something wrong.

93
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:54,625
PART.2: Oh I did this wrong. It's like this.

94
00:03:54,705 --> 00:04:00,185
PART.1: So we won't land safely...

95
00:04:00,425 --> 00:04:03,225
PART.2: Okay, now we have something like this.

96
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:05,465
PART.1: Oh we're good.

97
00:04:05,665 --> 00:04:11,909
PART.1: Now put it in yours. And then put it in which one?

98
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:11,985
PART.2: This one.

99
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:18,745
PART.1: And we need... We already had this. We have this and this one we have twice.

100
00:04:21,545 --> 00:04:24,425
PART.2: This is on there as well, nice.

101
00:04:25,185 --> 00:04:27,905
PART.1: So nice. And we're finished.

102
00:04:28,465 --> 00:04:33,065
PART.1: Ah look at this how it all started. It will start from Barcelona.

103
00:04:35,745 --> 00:04:36,825
PART.1: Oh my gosh.

104
00:04:37,185 --> 00:04:38,225
PART.2: Should we do another one?

105
00:04:38,305 --> 00:04:40,825
PART.1: Yay but it's working.

106
00:04:41,185 --> 00:04:42,425
PART.2: Oh look this is cute.

107
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:43,105
PART.1: That's very cute.

108
00:04:43,265 --> 00:04:46,185
PART.2: Then maybe we shouldn't do it. Maybe we shouldn't do it.

109
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:50,585
PART.1: But I'm really confused about this black and gray. I can't see the difference.

110
00:04:50,785 --> 00:04:53,025
PART.2: Black and gray? Do you think there's something else?

111
00:04:53,265 --> 00:04:58,185
PART.1: Because we had in the beginning this one and I wasn't sure if it was grey or black. But in the end we found black so it's fine.

112
00:04:58,425 --> 00:05:00,105
PART.2: But everything isn't gray.

113
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:07,345
PART.1: Yeah long as long as it's fitting. That means that the sign is following Gaudi. We have to put some orange in it.

114
00:05:07,785 --> 00:05:11,865
PART.2: Oh let's. We should put... Isn't there some figures so we can put them.

115
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:12,865
PART.1: Here is a plant.

116
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,545
PART.2: We can put you and me in here.

117
00:05:14,745 --> 00:05:21,945
PART.1: I can find you and me on some ice. We already have some and have some plants and trees. I mean it has to fit with nature.

118
00:05:23,145 --> 00:05:27,865
PART.2: We should do this. This is very cute.

119
00:05:28,065 --> 00:05:28,505
PART.1: Sure.

120
00:05:28,665 --> 00:05:30,665
PART.2: Maybe a pen...

121
00:05:30,745 --> 00:05:32,865
PART.1: You want to do the huge one? Okay.

122
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:35,865
PART.2: I don't know maybe you should, maybe we should not.

123
00:05:35,945 --> 00:05:38,865
PART.1: We should not. We can't...

124
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:41,465
PART.2: Because he needs to break them again. So no.

125
00:05:41,545 --> 00:05:50,065
PART.1: I‚Äôm not sure what is he recording right now, like, you already finished your task. Now you're just looking how we make some stuff. What do you think you're doing?

126
00:05:50,265 --> 00:05:55,265
PART.2: I don't know we‚ are having fun... Maybe just called him out. Or do we have to wait?

127
00:05:55,465 --> 00:06:02,545
PART.1: It was just waiting and doing bullshit really. Doing bullshit.

128
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:09,545
PART.2: That's what I was telling you. That Gaudi...Didn‚Äôt he die at age 73.

129
00:06:09,865 --> 00:06:11,545
PART.1: 73?

130
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,745
PART.2: Yeah, that's what I read yesterday.

131
00:06:12,985 --> 00:06:16,625
PART.1: What? I thought he died very young.

132
00:06:16,645 --> 00:06:18,835
PART.2: I thought so too.

133
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:27,985
PART.1: I thought it was 37, maybe I mixed it up. But it was like with the cable car. A cable car hit him then they brought him to the wrong emergency.

134
00:06:28,105 --> 00:06:32,690
PART.2: Because I was looking up his grave. Because I want to see what the inside would look like because we didn't see it.

135
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:33,105
PART.1: Oh yes.

136
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:35,145
PART.2: And I don't remember we saw it.

137
00:06:35,265 --> 00:06:36,185
PART.1: But it's there?

138
00:06:36,265 --> 00:06:37,345
PART.2: It's there. They say it's there.

139
00:06:37,425 --> 00:06:38,825
PART.1: In which side did you see it?

140
00:06:38,905 --> 00:06:46,545
PART.2: I don't know they just had a picture of it. They don't have like a bigger picture. So you wouldn't know which side it is. And I didn't read much to know where it is.

141
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:55,745
PART.1: Maybe it was under reconstruction. Because there was not much. Coming in. We could do this wrong and we got to here But if you came more further there was just a crucifix.

142
00:06:55,985 --> 00:06:56,945
PART.2: This door...

143
00:06:56,893 --> 00:06:58,425
PART.1: And there was no...

144
00:06:57,985 --> 00:06:58,865
PART.2: Oh yeah.

145
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:00,505
PART.1: No, I don't think so, there wasn't.

146
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:02,465
PART.2: There was a door with all the languages. It was on the side.

147
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:03,425
PART.1: On this side, yeah.

148
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:07,025
PART.2: But maybe it was closed. Because we didn't see it.

149
00:07:07,105 --> 00:07:19,545
PART.1: 73 would be normal age. It makes more sense. I mean he created so many houses, yeah. I was, like, 37! That's really impressive. To have the three houses for the families. And the big sagrada Familia plan

150
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,745
PART.2: True. Where do you put this?

151
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:32,705
PART.1: We needed to do, like, a horse but like this and brown and a bit different. And we did it wrong. First.

152
00:07:32,905 --> 00:07:33,625
PART.2: You did it wrong?

153
00:07:33,905 --> 00:07:43,145
PART.1: But we double checked. We were like look at the picture. It needs to eat some grass. And we were like it's not fitting the grass under it. And then we did something...

154
00:07:43,305 --> 00:07:44,305
PART.2: I like the door.

155
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:47,025
PART.1: Really? You want a picture with it?

156
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:49,745
PART.2: Oh come on.

157
00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:56,745
PART.2: Yeah sure. And I think this is that like the ring thing that she was wearing...Never mind.

158
00:07:57,025 --> 00:08:03,305
PART.1: Oh sure. To make it...Where is your ring? Why didn't you put it on?. I'm always wearing these...

159
00:08:03,705 --> 00:08:05,145
PART.2: Yeah you‚Äôre... I don't know.

160
00:08:05,305 --> 00:08:06,305
PART.1: You forgot it.

161
00:08:06,505 --> 00:08:10,465
