That's what I was telling you. That Gaudi...Didn‚Äôt he die at age 73. 
Yeah, that's what I read yesterday. 
I thought so too. 
Because I was looking up his grave. Because I want to see what the inside would look like because we didn't see it. 
And I don't remember we saw it. 
It's there. They say it's there. 
I don't know they just had a picture of it. They don't have like a bigger picture. So you wouldn't know which side it is. And I didn't read much to know where it is. 
This door... 
Oh yeah.
