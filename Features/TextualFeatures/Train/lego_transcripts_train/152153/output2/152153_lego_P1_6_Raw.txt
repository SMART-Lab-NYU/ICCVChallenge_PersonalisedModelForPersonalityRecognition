73? 
What? I thought he died very young. 
I thought it was 37, maybe I mixed it up. But it was like with the cable car. A cable car hit him then they brought him to the wrong emergency. 
Oh yes. 
But it's there? 
In which side did you see it? 
Maybe it was under reconstruction. Because there was not much. Coming in. We could do this wrong and we got to here But if you came more further there was just a crucifix. 
And there was no... 
No, I don't think so, there wasn't.
