95
00:04:00,425 --> 00:04:03,225
PART.2: Okay, now we have something like this.

96
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:05,465
PART.1: Oh we're good.

97
00:04:05,665 --> 00:04:11,909
PART.1: Now put it in yours. And then put it in which one?

98
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:11,985
PART.2: This one.

99
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:18,745
PART.1: And we need... We already had this. We have this and this one we have twice.

100
00:04:21,545 --> 00:04:24,425
PART.2: This is on there as well, nice.

101
00:04:25,185 --> 00:04:27,905
PART.1: So nice. And we're finished.

102
00:04:28,465 --> 00:04:33,065
PART.1: Ah look at this how it all started. It will start from Barcelona.

103
00:04:35,745 --> 00:04:36,825
PART.1: Oh my gosh.

104
00:04:37,185 --> 00:04:38,225
PART.2: Should we do another one?

105
00:04:38,305 --> 00:04:40,825
PART.1: Yay but it's working.

106
00:04:41,185 --> 00:04:42,425
PART.2: Oh look this is cute.

107
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:43,105
PART.1: That's very cute.

108
00:04:43,265 --> 00:04:46,185
PART.2: Then maybe we shouldn't do it. Maybe we shouldn't do it.

109
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:50,585
PART.1: But I'm really confused about this black and gray. I can't see the difference.

110
00:04:50,785 --> 00:04:53,025
PART.2: Black and gray? Do you think there's something else?

111
00:04:53,265 --> 00:04:58,185
PART.1: Because we had in the beginning this one and I wasn't sure if it was grey or black. But in the end we found black so it's fine.

112
00:04:58,425 --> 00:05:00,105
PART.2: But everything isn't gray.
