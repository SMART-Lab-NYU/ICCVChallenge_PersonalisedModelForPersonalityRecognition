128
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:09,545
PART.2: That's what I was telling you. That Gaudi...Didn‚Äôt he die at age 73.

129
00:06:09,865 --> 00:06:11,545
PART.1: 73?

130
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,745
PART.2: Yeah, that's what I read yesterday.

131
00:06:12,985 --> 00:06:16,625
PART.1: What? I thought he died very young.

132
00:06:16,645 --> 00:06:18,835
PART.2: I thought so too.

133
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:27,985
PART.1: I thought it was 37, maybe I mixed it up. But it was like with the cable car. A cable car hit him then they brought him to the wrong emergency.

134
00:06:28,105 --> 00:06:32,690
PART.2: Because I was looking up his grave. Because I want to see what the inside would look like because we didn't see it.

135
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:33,105
PART.1: Oh yes.

136
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:35,145
PART.2: And I don't remember we saw it.

137
00:06:35,265 --> 00:06:36,185
PART.1: But it's there?

138
00:06:36,265 --> 00:06:37,345
PART.2: It's there. They say it's there.

139
00:06:37,425 --> 00:06:38,825
PART.1: In which side did you see it?

140
00:06:38,905 --> 00:06:46,545
PART.2: I don't know they just had a picture of it. They don't have like a bigger picture. So you wouldn't know which side it is. And I didn't read much to know where it is.

141
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:55,745
PART.1: Maybe it was under reconstruction. Because there was not much. Coming in. We could do this wrong and we got to here But if you came more further there was just a crucifix.

142
00:06:55,985 --> 00:06:56,945
PART.2: This door...

143
00:06:56,893 --> 00:06:58,425
PART.1: And there was no...

144
00:06:57,985 --> 00:06:58,865
PART.2: Oh yeah.

145
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:00,505
PART.1: No, I don't think so, there wasn't.
