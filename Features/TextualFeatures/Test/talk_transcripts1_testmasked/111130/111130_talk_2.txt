45
00:02:21,654 --> 00:02:28,203
PART.2: And this time they have killed them, but that doesn't mean that they're gone forever, that means they're gonna come back again, there's gonna be another long night, you know?

PART.2: ... was like "Ah!"

55
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:54,494
PART.2: instead of... remember when he told her: "I'm actually your brother's son"?

56
00:02:54,574 --> 00:03:00,829
PART.2: She was like "Ah!", instead of "Oh my God, your my family", she was like "Ah! You wanna take my throne away from me? Bitch!"
