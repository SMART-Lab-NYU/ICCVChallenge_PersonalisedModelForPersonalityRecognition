1
00:00:03,847 --> 00:00:05,473
PART.2: So, let’s try...

2
00:00:05,838 --> 00:00:07,054
PART.1: Now, we go

3
00:00:07,134 --> 00:00:09,842
PART.2: Let’s try to keep it in the English language, for sure.

4
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,231
PART.1: Let’s try to keep in English, exactly.

5
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:11,792
PART.2: so,

6
00:00:11,872 --> 00:00:14,504
PART.1: how did you like the last the last episode?

7
00:00:14,584 --> 00:00:15,637
PART.2: Of Game of Thrones?

8
00:00:15,717 --> 00:00:16,295
PART.1: Yes.

9
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:22,160
PART.2: I mean, I was so excited when it came out, and when I saw it was so long, I was even more excited...

10
00:00:21,053 --> 00:00:22,160
PART.1: I don’t, I don’t remember [MASKED]

11
00:00:24,159 --> 00:00:25,083
PART.2: [MASKED], remember?

12
00:00:25,163 --> 00:00:25,939
PART.1: Ah, yes.

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,828
PART.2: The battle that they’ve been building up for... 8 years, and that I thought it was going to be the end, end...

14
00:00:30,788 --> 00:00:34,083
PART.1: you think each season took the whole year? I’m not quite sure.

15
00:00:34,163 --> 00:00:37,100
PART.2: It came out on the first, like the first episode came out in 2008

16
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:37,810
PART.1: Seriously?

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:38,385
PART.2: Yeah.

18
00:00:38,465 --> 00:00:38,920
PART.1: Oh, [MASKED]

19
00:00:40,919 --> 00:00:41,743
PART.2: [MASKED] fucking years.

20
00:00:41,823 --> 00:00:46,503
PART.2: And I always thought that the, like the whole, like since the first episode has always been like the winters are coming...

21
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:47,905
PART.1: Right, and now...

22
00:00:46,785 --> 00:00:52,342
PART.2: I thought they were building the end of the end, but no, the end is gonna be Cersei being a bitch, and the end, like...

23
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:14,538
PART.2: Remember?

24
00:01:14,618 --> 00:01:18,208
PART.1: Yeah, but there could be a second king, or... Oh! There could be a queen, actually.

25
00:01:19,029 --> 00:01:19,440
PART.1: We didn't think [MASKED]

26
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,119
PART.1: [MASKED] going on".

27
00:01:21,835 --> 00:01:24,795
PART.2: The queen of ice... Because, I... You know, Jon Snow?

28
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:35,596
PART.2: He made like a... like a... interview, like a talk show or... And they were asking: "What's the end like?", "What's the end...", they kept asking him before it came out, and he's like: "Yeah, it's something you're never gonna expect".

29
00:01:35,676 --> 00:01:38,674
PART.2: Like, it's something that I didn't even expect, when I read it, i was like, what the fuck?

30
00:01:38,754 --> 00:01:42,925
PART.2: And he told his wife, you know, his wife is like... "You know nothing Jon Snow".

31
00:01:42,772 --> 00:01:45,436
PART.1: Oh, true, that's true.

32
00:01:44,097 --> 00:01:49,030
PART.2: She's out of the show, so she didn't know what the fuck was going on in the screenplay, and everything.

33
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,800
PART.2: And he told her at the end, and she was so pi [MASKED]

34
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,782
PART.2: [MASKED] would you tell me that?"

35
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:56,008
PART.1: It could actually happen, it could actually be like that.

36
00:01:55,808 --> 00:01:56,864
PART.2: There could be a queen.

37
00:01:56,178 --> 00:01:57,504
PART.1: It would make a lot of sense.

38
00:01:57,224 --> 00:01:59,499
PART.2: Or maybe Cersei becomes the Ice Queen.

39
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,461
PART.2: Maybe that's how everything starts, where did the Ice King come from? I mean, maybe he was a king before.

40
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,691
PART.1: How did the ice army even start?

41
00:02:06,724 --> 00:02:13,932
PART.1: That's what I don't understand, I understand that there's one, that they always got more and more, because they have this weird power going on, but...

42
00:02:06,771 --> 00:02:07,444
PART.2: I don't know.

43
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:16,320
PART.2: And they say always that... [MASKED]

44
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,574
PART.2: [MASKED] nights, so, like, this war has happened a lot of times before.

45
00:02:21,654 --> 00:02:28,203
PART.2: And this time they have killed them, but that doesn't mean that they're gone forever, that means they're gonna come back again, there's gonna be another long night, you know?

46
00:02:27,603 --> 00:02:28,568
PART.1: Yeah.

47
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:30,427
PART.2: So, who knows.

48
00:02:30,507 --> 00:02:32,267
PART.1: Put Cersei on the top.

49
00:02:32,347 --> 00:02:35,178
PART.2: Either Cersei fucks everyone up and she becomes a queen...

50
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:37,939
PART.2: Or the Ice People come back...

51
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:43,879
PART.1: But don't forget that it's still about that Jon is actually the real heir to the throne.

52
00:02:43,282 --> 00:02:44,647
PART.2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:47,195
PART.1: So, that's gonna happen too, somehow.

54
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:48,509
PART.2: ... was like "Ah!"

55
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:54,494
PART.2: instead of... remember when he told her: "I'm actually your brother's son"?

56
00:02:54,574 --> 00:03:00,829
PART.2: She was like "Ah!", instead of "Oh my God, your my family", she was like "Ah! You wanna take my throne away from me? Bitch!"

57
00:02:58,738 --> 00:03:00,583
PART.1: Yeah, yeah, of course.

58
00:03:01,404 --> 00:03:07,714
PART.1: It had to be actually very, very strange for them to film that scene, right? The loving scene.

59
00:03:01,856 --> 00:03:03,191
PART.2: That's a weird love.

60
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,471
PART.2: I think so.

61
00:03:07,551 --> 00:03:09,369
PART.2: I mean, they're both married, I think.

62
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:10,749
PART.2: I mean, Jon Snow is married.

63
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:15,372
PART.1: Yeah, no, because they got friends and everything, thoughout the years, and then they had to make this love scene, it was probably super strange.

64
00:03:15,172 --> 00:03:16,421
PART.2: I mean, Arya, man.

65
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:21,162
PART.2: She started the show when she was literally 12 and she, like, had this sex scene at the end...

66
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:24,793
PART.1: Yeah, she was so cute in the beginning, she was such a sweetheart. Sansa too.

67
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:31,640
PART.2: Like, at the beginning, beginning, before everything went out in Winterfell, remember when she was like training with this guy and the dancer... That was so [MASKED]

68
00:03:29,454 --> 00:03:31,302
PART.1: Yeah, yeah.

69
00:03:34,025 --> 00:03:35,692
PART.1: King Geoffrey!

70
00:03:35,772 --> 00:03:37,368
PART.2: Motherfucker.

71
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:43,579
PART.1: I cut my finger before, when we did the... No, actually I cut my finger at 100 montaditos when I opened the menu before...

72
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:46,249
PART.2: Shit, papercuts are the worst.

73
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:49,633
PART.1: No, it's a plastic cut, what is even worse.

74
00:03:52,846 --> 00:03:53,846
PART.2: Oops.

75
00:03:53,926 --> 00:03:55,147
PART.1: How long do we have to do this?

76
00:03:55,227 --> 00:03:56,250
PART.2: I have no clue.

77
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,271
PART.2: But let's talk about the triple planning.

78
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,160
PART.1: The... Which one?

79
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:01,160
PART.2: The... [MASKED]

80
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,084
PART.2: [MASKED] we had, the Whatsapp group.

81
00:04:04,123 --> 00:04:14,615
PART.1: Yeah. No one was really answering, like I know that I have the drivers license, like a lot, that has one, no one else has his drivers license, which means... people, but...

82
00:04:05,978 --> 00:04:07,164
PART.2: Yeah!

83
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,618
PART.2: Yeah.

84
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:18,656
PART.2: But do you wanna go so many people, though?

85
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,872
PART.2: We're not ten. Or...?

86
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:25,397
PART.1: I don't know.

87
00:04:25,037 --> 00:04:26,401
PART.2: I keep switching.

88
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:30,273
PART.1: I know, it's really hard to only speak in English, it's getting me very like..."nieh".

89
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:43,069
PART.1: No, I think it's you, it's me, it's Carlota, Victoria, Elio... And maybe we could either do like a smaller group with like one car, maybe?

90
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:39,586
PART.2: Carlota, Victoria, Elio, Alex... Julia?

91
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:47,111
PART.2: I would rather do that actually, if not, it's gonna be way too like...

92
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:51,126
PART.1: It could be fun, though, it could be really fun if like 10-15 people would come.

93
00:04:49,051 --> 00:05:00,551
PART.2: Yeah but... Julia, for ex... Like, you have a good relationwhip with her, no offense, or something, but like, I don't know if I wanna be on a car, on a trip for three days with Julia, and if Julia comes, Isa is gonna come too.

94
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:11,010
PART.2: I can't sit, eat in each other's face anymore, like I literally can't. Like, okay, you love each other, fine, but, like, can you love each other behind the closed doors?
